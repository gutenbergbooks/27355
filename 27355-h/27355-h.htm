<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>BACK FROM THE DEAD</h3>
</div>

<p>Westward the little three-car train chugged
its way fussily across the brown prairie toward
distant mountains which, in that clear atmosphere,
loomed so deceptively near. Standing motionless beside
the weather-beaten station shed, the solitary
passenger watched it absently, brows drawn into a
single dark line above the bridge of his straight nose.
Tall, lean, with legs spread apart a bit and shoulders
slightly bent, he made a striking figure against that
background of brilliant sky and drenching, golden sunlight.
For a brief space he did not stir. Then of a
sudden, when the train had dwindled to the size of a
child&#8217;s toy, he turned abruptly and drew a long, deep
breath.</p>
<p>It was a curious transformation. A moment before
his face&mdash;lined, brooding, somber, oddly pale for that
country of universal tan&mdash;looked almost old. At
least one would have felt it the face of a man who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
had recently endured a great deal of mental or physical
suffering. Now, as he turned with an unconscious
straightening of broad shoulders and a characteristic
uptilt of square, cleft chin, the lines smoothed away
miraculously, a touch of red crept into his lean cheeks,
an eager, boyish gleam of expectation flashed into the
clear gray eyes that rested caressingly on the humdrum,
sleepy picture before him.</p>
<p>Humdrum it was, in all conscience. A single street,
wide enough, almost, for a plaza, paralleled the railroad
tracks, the buildings, such as they were, all strung
along the further side in an irregular line. One of
these, ramshackle, weather-worn, labeled laconically
&#8220;The Store,&#8221; stood directly opposite the station. The
architecture of the &#8220;Paloma Springs Hotel,&#8221; next door,
was very similar. On either side of these two structures
a dozen or more discouraged-looking adobe
houses were set down at uneven intervals. To the eastward
the street ended in the corrals and shipping-pens;
in the other direction it merged into a narrow dusty
trail that curved northward from the twin steel rails
and quickly lost itself in the encompassing prairie.</p>
<p>That was all. Paloma Springs in its entirety lay
there in full view, drowsing in the torrid heat of mid-September.
Not a human being was in sight. Only
a brindled dog slept in a small patch of shade beside the
store; and fastened to the hotel hitching-rack, two
burros, motionless save for twitching tails and ears,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
were almost hidden beneath stupendous loads of firewood.</p>
<p>But to Buck Stratton the charm lay deeper than
mere externals. As a matter of fact he had seen Paloma
Springs only twice in his life, and then very
briefly. But it was a typical little cow-town of the
Southwest, and to the homesick cattleman the sight
of it was like a refreshing draft of water in the
desert. Pushing back his hat, Stratton drew another
full breath, the beginnings of a smile curving the corners
of his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is good to get back,&#8221; he murmured, picking
up his bag. &#8220;Someway the very air tastes different.
Gosh almighty. It don&#8217;t seem like two years,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abruptly the light went out of his eyes and his face
clouded. No wonder the time seemed short when one
of those years had vanished from his life as utterly and
completely as if it had never been. Whenever Stratton
thought of it, which was no oftener than he could
help, he cringed mentally. There was something
uncanny and even horrible in the realization that for
the better part of a twelve-month he had been eating,
sleeping, walking about, making friends, even, like
any normal person, without retaining a single atom
of recollection of the entire period.</p>
<p>Frowning, Buck put up one hand and absently
touched a freshly healed scar half-hidden by his thick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
hair. Even now there were moments when he felt
the whole thing must be some wild nightmare. Vividly
he remembered the sudden winking out of consciousness
in the midst of that panting, uphill
dash through Belleau Wood. He could recall perfectly
the most trifling event leading up to it&mdash;the
breaking down of his motor-cycle in a strange sector
just before the charge, his sudden determination to
take part in it by hook or crook, even the thrill and
tingle of that advance against heavy machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>The details of his awakening were equally clear.
It was like closing his eyes one minute and opening
them the next. He lay on a hospital bed, his head
swathed in bandages. That seemed all right. He
had been wounded in the charge against the Boche,
and they had carried him to a field-hospital. He was
darned lucky to have come out of it alive.</p>
<p>But little by little the conviction was forced upon
him that it wasn&#8217;t as simple as that. At length, when
he was well on the way to recovery, he learned to his
horror that the interval of mental blankness, instead
of being a few hours, or at the most a day or two,
had lasted for over a year!</p>
<p>Without fully understanding certain technical portions
of the doctor&#8217;s explanation, Stratton gathered
that the bullet which had laid him low had produced
a bone-pressure on the portion of his brain which was
the seat of memory. The wound healing, he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
recovered perfect physical health, but with a mind blank
of anything previous to his awakening in the French
hospital over a year ago. The recent operation, which
was pronounced entirely successful, had been performed
to relieve that pressure, and Stratton was informed
that all he needed was a few weeks of convalescence
to make him as good a man as he had ever
been.</p>
<p>It took Buck all of that time to adjust himself to
the situation. He was in America instead of France,
without the slightest recollection of getting there.
The war was over long ago. A thousand things had
happened of which he had not the remotest knowledge.
And because he was a very normal, ordinary young
man with a horror of anything queer and eccentric, the
thought of that mysterious year filled him with dismay
and roused in him a passionate longing to escape at
once from everything which would remind him of his
uncanny lapse of memory. If he were only back
where he belonged in the land of wide spaces, of clean,
crisp air and blue, blue sky, he felt he would
quickly forget this nightmare which haunted so many
waking moments.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there were complications. To begin
with he found himself in the extraordinary position of
a man without identity. The record sent over from
the hospital in France stated that he had been brought
in from the field minus his tag and every other mark of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
identification. Buck was not surprised at this, nor at
the failure of anyone in the strange sector to recognize
him. Only a few hours before the battle the tape
of his identification-disk had parted and he had thrust
the thing carelessly into his pocket. He had seen too
many wounded men brought into field-hospitals not to
realize how easy it is to lose a blouse.</p>
<p>Recovering from the bullet-wound and unable to tell
anything about himself, he had apparently passed under
the name of Robert Green. Stratton wondered
with a touch of grim amusement whether this christening
was not the result of doughboy humor. He
must have been green enough, in all conscience.</p>
<p>He was not even grimly amused by the ultimate discovery
that the name of Roth Stratton had appeared
months and months ago on one of the official lists of
&#8220;killed or missing.&#8221; It increased his discomfort over
the whole hateful business and made him thankful for
the first time that he was alone in the world. At least
no mother or sister had been tortured by this strange
prank of fate.</p>
<p>But at last the miles of red tape had been untied or
cut, and the moment his discharge came Stratton took
the first possible train out of New York. He did not
even wire Bloss, his ranch-foreman, that he was coming.
As a matter of fact he felt that doing so would
only further complicate an already sufficiently difficult
situation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>The Shoe-Bar outfit, in western Arizona, had been
his property barely a week before he left it for the recruiting-office.
Born and bred in the Texas Panhandle,
he inherited his father&#8217;s ranch when barely
twenty-one. Even then many of the big outfits were
being cut up into farms, public range-land had virtually
ceased to exist, and one by one the cattlemen were
driven westward before the slowly encroaching wave
of civilization.</p>
<p>Two years later Stratton decided to give up the fight
and follow them. During the winter before the war
he sold out for a handsome figure, spent several
months looking over new ground, and finally located
and bought the Shoe-Bar outfit.</p>
<p>The deal was hurried through because of his determination
to enlist. Indeed, he would probably not
have purchased at all had not the new outfit, even to
his hasty inspection, seemed to be so unusual a bargain
and so exactly what he wanted. But buy he did,
placed Joe Bloss, a reliable and experienced cattleman
who had been with him for years, in charge, and departed.</p>
<p>From that moment he had never once set eyes on the
Shoe-Bar. Bloss wrote frequent and painstaking reports
which seemed to indicate that everything was going
well. But all through the long and tedious journey
ending at the little Arizona way-station, Stratton
fumed and fretted and wondered. Even if Joe had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
failed to see his name amongst the missing, what must
he have thought of his interminable silence? All
through Buck&#8217;s brief training and the longer interval
overseas, the foreman&#8217;s letters had come with fair
regularity and been answered promptly and in detail.
What had Bloss done when the break came? What
had he been doing ever since?</p>
<p>A fresh wave of troubled curiosity sent Stratton
swinging briskly across the street. Keeping inside the
long hitching-rack, he crossed the sagging porch and
stepped through the open door into the store. For a
moment he thought it empty. Then a chair scraped,
and over in one corner a short, stout, grizzled man
dropped his feet from the window-sill and shuffled
forward, yawning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal! Wal!&#8221; he mumbled, his faded, sleep-dazed
eyes taking in Buck&#8217;s bag. &#8220;Train come in? Reckon
I must of been dozin&#8217; a mite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me like the whole place was taking an
afternoon nap,&#8221; smiled Stratton. &#8220;Not much doing
this time of day, I expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it,&#8221; yawned the stout man, supporting
himself against the rough pine counter. &#8220;Things is
liable to brisk up in a hour or two, though, when the
boys begin to drift in. Stranger around these parts,
ain&#8217;t yuh?&#8221; he added curiously.</p>
<p>For a tiny space Buck hesitated. Then, moved by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
an involuntary impulse he did not even pause to analyze,
he shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was out at the Shoe-Bar a couple of times about
two years ago,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t been around
here since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Shoe-Bar? Huh?&#8221; Pop Daggett looked interested.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so! Funny I don&#8217;t recollect
yore face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so very. I only passed through here to take
the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was it, eh? Two years ago must of been
about the time the outfit was bought by that Stratton
feller from Texas. Yuh know him well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Bloss, the foreman, was a friend of mine,&#8221;
evaded Stratton. &#8220;He&#8217;s the one I stopped off now to
see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop Daggett&#8217;s jaw sagged, betraying a cavernous
expanse of sparsely-toothed gums. &#8220;Joe Bloss!&#8221; he
ejaculated. &#8220;My land! I hope you ain&#8217;t traveled
far fur that. If so, yuh sure got yore trouble for yore
pains. Why, man alive! Joe Bloss ain&#8217;t been nigh the
Shoe-Bar for close on to a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton&#8217;s eyes narrowed. &#8220;A year?&#8221; he repeated
curtly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s he gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got me. I did hear he&#8217;d signed up with the
Flying-V&#8217;s over to New Mexico, but that might have
been jest talk.&#8221; He sniffed disapprovingly. &#8220;There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
ain&#8217;t no doubt about it; the old Shoe-Bar&#8217;s changed
powerful these two years. I dunno what we&#8217;re
comin&#8217; to with wimmin buttin&#8217; into the cattle business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck stared at him in frank amazement. &#8220;Women?&#8221;
he repeated. &#8220;What the dickens are you talking
about, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sh&#8217;d think I was plain enough,&#8221; retorted Pop
Daggett with some asperity. &#8220;Mebbe female ranchers
ain&#8217;t no novelty to yuh, but this is the first time I ever
run up ag&#8217;in one m&#8217;self, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t much in love with
the idear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton&#8217;s teeth dug into his under lip, and one hand
gripped the edge of the counter with a force that
brought out a row of white dots across the knuckles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to tell me there&#8217;s a&mdash;a&mdash;woman at the
Shoe-Bar?&#8221; he asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;At it?&#8221; snorted the old man. &#8220;Why, by cripes,
she <i>owns</i> it! Not only that, but folks say she&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to run the outfit herself like as if she was a man.&#8221; He
paused to spit accurately and with volume into the
empty stove. &#8220;Her name&#8217;s Thorne,&#8221; he added
curtly. &#8220;Mary Thorne.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>CROOKED WORK</h3>
</div>

<p>Stratton suddenly turned his back and stared
blankly through the open door. With the same
unconscious instinct which had moved him to conceal
his face from the old man, he fumbled in one pocket
and drew forth papers and tobacco sack. It spoke
well for his self-control that his fingers were almost
steady as he deliberately fashioned a cigarette and
thrust it between his lips. When he had lighted it and
inhaled a puff or two, he turned slowly to Pop Daggett
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure know how to shoot a surprise into a fellow,
old-timer,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;A woman rancher, eh?
That&#8217;s going some around this country, I&#8217;ll say.
How long has she&mdash;er&mdash;owned the Shoe-Bar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only since her pa died about four months back.&#8221;
Pop Daggett assumed an easier pose; his tone had
softened to one of garrulous satisfaction at having a
new listener to a tale he had worn threadbare. &#8220;It&#8217;s
consid&#8217;able of a story, but if yuh ain&#8217;t pressed for
time&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it,&#8221; invited Buck, leaning back against the
counter. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got all the time there is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daggett&#8217;s small, faded blue eyes regarded him
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did yuh ever meet up with this here Stratton?&#8221; he
asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;a&mdash;know what he looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more&#8217;n I do,&#8221; grumbled Pop regretfully.
&#8220;The only two times he was here I was laid up with a
mean attack of rheumatiz, an&#8217; never sot eyes on him.
Still an&#8217; all, there ain&#8217;t hardly anybody else around
Paloma that more &#8217;n glimpsed him passin&#8217; through.
He bought the outfit in a terrible hurry, an&#8217; I thinks
to m&#8217;self at the time he must be awful trustin&#8217;, or else
a mighty right smart jedge uh land an&#8217; cattle. He
couldn&#8217;t of hardly rid over it even once real thorough
before he plunks down his money, gets him a proper
title, an&#8217; hikes off to the war, leavin&#8217; Joe Bloss in
charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, fished in his pocket, and, producing a
plug, carefully bit off one corner. Stratton watched
him impatiently, a faint flush staining his clear, curiously
white skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he prodded presently. &#8220;What happened
then? From what I know of Joe, I&#8217;ll say he made
good all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure he did.&#8221; Pop spoke with emphasis, though
somewhat thickly. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t nobody can tell Joe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
Bloss much about cattle. He whirled in right capable
and got things runnin&#8217; good. For a while he was so
danged busy he&#8217;d hardly ever get to town, but come
winter the work eased up an&#8217; I used to see him right
frequent. He&#8217;d set there alongside the stove evenings
an&#8217; tell me what he was doin&#8217;, or how he&#8217;d jest had a
letter from Stratton, who was by now in France, an&#8217;
all the rest of it. Wal, to make a long story short,
a year last month the letters stopped comin&#8217;. Joe begun
to get worried, but I told him likely Stratton was
too busy fightin&#8217; to write, or he might even of got
wounded. Yuh could have knocked me down with
a wisp uh bunch-grass when one uh the boys come in
one night with a Phoenix paper, an&#8217; showed me Stratton&#8217;s
name on a list uh killed or missin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221; asked Buck briefly, seeing that
Daggett evidently expected some comment. If only
the man would get on!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Round the middle of September. Joe was jest
naturally shot to pieces, him knowin&#8217; young Stratton
from a kid an&#8217; likin&#8217; him fine, besides bein&#8217; consid&#8217;able
worried about what was goin&#8217; to happen to the
ranch an&#8217; him. Still an&#8217; all, there wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; he
could do but go on holdin&#8217; down his job, which he done
until the big bust along the end of October.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused again expectantly. Buck ground the
butt of his cigarette under one heel and reached for
the makings. He had an almost irresistible desire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
to take the garrulous old man by the shoulders and
shake him till his teeth rattled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was this here Thorne from Chicago,&#8221; resumed
Daggett, a trifle disappointed. Usually at this point
of the story, his listener broke in with exclamation or
interested question. &#8220;He showed up one morning
with the sheriff an&#8217; claimed the ranch was his. Said
Stratton had sold it to him an&#8217; produced the deed,
signed, sealed, an&#8217; witnessed all right an&#8217; proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Match in one hand and cigarette in the other, Buck
stared at him, the picture of arrested motion. For
a moment or two his brain whirled. Could he possibly
have done such a thing and not remember? With
a ghastly sinking of his heart he realized that anything
might have been possible during that hateful vanished
year. Mechanically he lit his cigarette and of a
sudden he grew calmer. According to the hospital
records he had not left France until well into November
of the preceding year. Tossing the match into
the stove, he met Pop Daggett&#8217;s glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could that be?&#8221; he asked briefly. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
you say this Stratton was in France for months before
he was killed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop nodded hearty agreement. &#8220;That&#8217;s jest what
I said, an&#8217; so did Bloss. But according to Thorne this
here transfer was made a couple uh weeks before
Stratton went over to France.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s impossible!&#8221; exclaimed Buck hotly.
&#8220;How could he have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He ceased abruptly and bit his lip. Daggett chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gettin&#8217; kinda interested, ain&#8217;t yuh?&#8221; he remarked
in a satisfied tone. &#8220;I thought you would &#8217;fore I
was done. I don&#8217;t say as it&#8217;s impossible, but it shore
looked queer to me. As Joe says, why would he go an&#8217;
sell the outfit jest after buyin&#8217; it without a word to him.
Not only that but he kept on writin&#8217; about how Joe
was to do this an&#8217; that an&#8217; the other thing like he was
mighty interested in havin&#8217; it run good. Joe, he even
got suspicions uh somethin&#8217; crooked an&#8217; hired a lawyer
to look into it, Stratton not havin&#8217; any folks. But
that&#8217;s all the good it done him. He couldn&#8217;t pick no
flaw in it at all. Seems Stratton was in Chicago on
one of these here furloughs jest before he took ship.
One uh the witnesses had gone to war, but they hunted
out the other one an&#8217; he swore he&#8217;d seen the deed
signed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did this Thorne&mdash; What did you say his name
was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t recolleck sayin&#8217;, but it was Andrew J.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s lids narrowed; a curious gleam flashed for
an instant in his gray eyes and was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did Thorne explain why he let it go so long
before making his claim?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, shore! He was right there when it come to
explainin&#8217;. Seems he had some important war business
on his hands an&#8217; wanted to get shed uh that before
he took up ranchin&#8217;. Knowed it was in good hands,
&#8217;count uh Bloss bein&#8217; on the job, an&#8217; Stratton havin&#8217;
promised to write frequent an&#8217; keep Joe toein&#8217; the
mark. Stratton, it seems, had sold out because he
didn&#8217;t know what might happen to him across the
water. Oh, Andrew J. was a right smooth talker,
believe me, but still an&#8217; all he didn&#8217;t make no great
hit with folks around the country even after he settled
down on the Shoe-Bar and brung his daughter there
to live. There weren&#8217;t no tears shed, neither, when
an ornery paint horse throwed him last May an&#8217; broke
his neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Bloss?&#8221; Stratton asked briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he got his time along with all the other cow-men.
There shore was a clean sweep when Thorne
whirled in an&#8217; took hold. Joe hung around here a
week or two an&#8217; then drifted down to Phoenix. Last
I heard he was goin&#8217; to try the Flyin&#8217;-V&#8217;s, but that
was six months or more ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s shoulders straightened and his chin went
up with a sudden touch of swift decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a horse I can hire?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>
<p>Pop hesitated, his shrewd gaze traveling swiftly
over Stratton&#8217;s straight, tall figure to rest reflectively
on the lean, square-jawed, level-eyed young face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno but I have,&#8221; he answered slowly. &#8220;Uh
course I don&#8217;t know yore name even, an&#8217; a man&#8217;s
got to be careful how he&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; interrupted Stratton,
his white teeth showing briefly in a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
leave you a deposit. My name&#8217;s Bob Green, though
folks mostly call me Buck. I&#8217;ve got a notion to
ride over to the Shoe-Bar and see if they know anything
about&mdash;Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T ain&#8217;t likely they will,&#8221; shrugged Daggett.
&#8220;Still, it won&#8217;t do no harm to try. Yuh can&#8217;t ride in
them things, though,&#8221; he added, surveying Stratton&#8217;s
well-cut suit of gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t specially want to, but they&#8217;re all I&#8217;ve got,&#8221;
smiled Buck. &#8220;When I quit ranching to show &#8217;em
how to run the war, I left my outfit behind, and I
haven&#8217;t been back yet to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cow-man eh?&#8221; Pop nodded approvingly. &#8220;I
thought so; yuh got the look, someway. Wal, yore
welcome to some duds I bought off &#8217;n Dick Sanders
about a month ago. He quit the Rockin&#8217;-R to go
railroadin&#8217; or somethin&#8217;, an&#8217; sold his outfit, saddle
an&#8217; all. I reckon they&#8217;ll suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stepping behind the counter, he poked around
amongst a mass of miscellaneous merchandise and
finally drew forth a pair of much-worn leather chaps,
high-heeled boots almost new, and a cartridge-belt
from which dangled an empty holster.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There yuh are,&#8221; he said triumphantly, spreading
them out on the counter. &#8220;Gun&#8217;s the only thing
missin&#8217;. He kep&#8217; that, but likely yuh got one of yore
own. Saddle&#8217;s hangin&#8217; out in the stable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without delay Stratton took off his coat and vest
and sat down on an empty box to try the boots, which
proved a trifle large but still wearable. He already
had on a dark flannel shirt and a new Stetson, which
he had bought in New York; and when he pulled on
the chaps and buckled the cartridge-belt around his
slim waist Pop Daggett surveyed him with distinct
approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;All yuh need is a good coat uh tan to look like the
genuine article,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;How come yuh to be
so white?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t been out of the hospital long enough to
get browned up.&#8221; Buck opened his bag and, fumbling
for a moment, produced a forty-five army automatic.
&#8220;This don&#8217;t go very well with the outfit,&#8221; he shrugged.
&#8220;Happen to have a regular six-gun around the place
you&#8217;ll sell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop had, this being part of his stock in trade. Buck
looked the lot over carefully, finally picking out a
thirty-eight Colt with a good heft. When he had
paid for this and a supply of ammunition, Pop led
the way out to a shed back of the store and pointed
out a Fraser saddle, worn but in excellent condition,
hanging from a hook.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder to me any cow-man is ever fool
enough to sell his saddle,&#8221; commented Stratton as he
took it down. &#8220;They never get much for &#8217;em, and
new ones are so darn ornery to break in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh said it,&#8221; agreed Daggett. &#8220;I&#8217;d ruther buy
one second-hand than new any day. There&#8217;s the
bridle. Yuh take that roan in the near stall. He
ain&#8217;t much to look at, but he&#8217;ll travel all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later the roan, saddled and bridled,
pawed the dust beside the hitching rack in front of
the store, while Buck Stratton made a small bundle
of his coat, vest, and a few necessaries from his bag
and fastened it behind the saddle. The remainder of
his belongings had been left with Pop Daggett, who
lounged in the doorway fingering a roll of bills in
his trousers pocket and watching his new acquaintance
with smiling amiability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be going,&#8221; said Stratton, tying the last
knot securely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring your cayuse back to-morrow
or the day after at the latest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop looked surprised. &#8220;The day after?&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;What&#8217;s goin&#8217; to keep yuh that long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be needing the horse sooner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I dunno&#8217;s I will. But seems like yuh ought to
be back by noon to-morrow. It ain&#8217;t more &#8217;n eighteen
miles.&#8221; He straightened abruptly and his blue
eyes widened. &#8220;Say, young feller! Yuh ain&#8217;t thinkin&#8217;
of gettin a job out there, are yuh?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>Stratton hesitated for an instant. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t
know,&#8221; he shrugged presently. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get to
work right soon at something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daggett took a swift step or two across the sagging
porch, his face grown oddly serious. &#8220;Wal, I
wouldn&#8217;t try the Shoe-Bar, nohow. There&#8217;s the
Rockin&#8217;-R. They&#8217;re short a man or two. Yuh go
see Jim Tenny an&#8217; tell him&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the Shoe-Bar?&#8221; persisted
Buck.</p>
<p>Pop&#8217;s glance avoided Stratton&#8217;s. &#8220;Yuh&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
like it,&#8221; he mumbled, glancing down the trail. &#8220;It&mdash;it
ain&#8217;t like it was in Joe&#8217;s time. That there Tex
Lynch&mdash;he&mdash;he don&#8217;t get on with the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s he? The foreman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Beauty Lynch, some calls him &#8217;count uh his
looks. I ain&#8217;t denyin&#8217; he&#8217;s han&#8217;some, with them
black eyes an&#8217; red cheeks uh his, but somethin&#8217; queer&mdash;Like
I said, there ain&#8217;t nobody stays long at the Shoe-Bar.
Yuh take my advice, Buck, an&#8217; try the Rockin&#8217;-R.
They&#8217;s a nice bunch there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck swung himself easily into the saddle; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
think about it,&#8221; he smiled, gathering up the reins.
&#8220;Well, so-long; see you in a day or so, anyway.
Thanks for helping me out, old-timer.&#8221;</p>
<p>He loosened the reins, and the roan took the trail at
a canter. Well beyond the last adobe house, Stratton
glanced back to see old Pop Daggett still standing on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the store porch and staring after him. Buck flung
up one arm in a careless gesture of farewell; then a
gentle downward slope in the prairie carried him out
of sight of the little settlement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acts to me like he was holding back something,&#8221;
he thought as he rode briskly on through the wide,
rolling solitudes. &#8220;Now, I wonder what sort of a
guy is this Tex Lynch, and what&#8217;s going on at the
Shoe-Bar that an old he-gossip like Pop Daggett is
afraid to talk about?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>MISTRESS MARY&mdash;QUITE CONTRARY</h3>
</div>

<p>But Stratton&#8217;s mind was too full of the amazing
information he had gleaned from the old storekeeper
to leave much room for minor reflections. He
had been stunned at first&mdash;so completely floored that
anyone save the garrulous old man intent on making
the most of his shop-worn story could not have helped
seeing that something was seriously wrong. Then
anger came&mdash;a hot, raging fury against the authors
of this barefaced, impudent attempt at swindle. From
motives of policy he had done his best to conceal that,
too, from Pop Daggett; but now that he was alone it
surged up again within him, dyeing his face a deep
crimson and etching hard lines on his forehead and
about his straight-lipped mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought they&#8217;d put it over easy,&#8221; he growled behind
set teeth, one clenched, gloved hand thumping the
saddle-horn. &#8220;Saw the notice in the papers, of course,
and decided it would be a cinch to rob a dead man.
Well, there&#8217;s a surprise coming to somebody that&#8217;ll
make mine look like thirty cents.&#8221;</p>
<p>His lips relaxed in a grim smile, which presently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
merged into an expression of puzzled wonder.
Thorne, of all people, to try and put across a crooked
deal like this! Stratton had never known the man
really intimately, but during the several years of their
business relationship the Chicago lawyer struck him
as being scrupulously honest and upright. Indeed,
when Buck came to enlist, it seemed a perfectly safe
and natural thing to leave his deeds and other important
papers in Andrew Thorne&#8217;s keeping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shows how you can be fooled in a man,&#8221; murmured
Stratton, as he followed the trail down into a
shallow draw. &#8220;I sure played into his hands nice.
He had the deeds and everything, and it would be simple
enough to fake a transfer when he thought I was
dead and knew I hadn&#8217;t any kin to make trouble. I
wonder what the daughter&#8217;s like. A holy terror, I&#8217;ll
bet, and tarred with the same brush. Well, she&#8217;ll get
hers in about two hours&#8217; time, and get it good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grim smile flickered again on his lips for a
moment, to vanish as he saw the head and shoulders
of a horseman appear over the further edge of the
draw. An instant later the bulk of a big sorrel flashed
into view and thudded toward him.</p>
<p>On the open range men usually stop for a word or
two when they meet, but this one did not. As he
approached Stratton at a rapid speed there was a brief,
involuntary movement as if he meant to pull up and
then changed his mind. The next moment he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
whirled past with a careless, negligent gesture of one
hand and a keen, penetrating, questioning stare from
a pair of hard black eyes.</p>
<p>Buck glanced over one shoulder at the flying dust-cloud
and pursed his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder if that&#8217;s the mysterious Tex?&#8221; he pondered,
urging his horse forward. &#8220;Black eyes and
red cheeks, all right. He&#8217;s a good looking scoundrel&mdash;too
darn good looking for a man. All the same, I
can&#8217;t say it was a case of love at first sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unconsciously his right hand dropped to the holster
at his side, the fingers caressing for an instant the butt
of his Colt. He had set out on his errand of exposure
with an angry impulsiveness which gave no thought
to details or possibilities. But in some subtle fashion
that searching glance from the passing stranger
brought him up with a little mental jerk. For the
first time he remembered that he was playing a lone
hand, that the very nature of his business was likely
to rouse the most desperate and unscrupulous opposition.
Considering the value of the stake and the penalties
involved, the present occupant of the Shoe-Bar
was likely to use every means in her power to prevent
his accusations from becoming public. If the fellow
who had just passed really was Tex Lynch, Buck had
a strong intuition that he was the sort of a man who
could be counted on to take a prominent hand in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
game, and also that he wouldn&#8217;t be any too particular
as to how he played it.</p>
<p>A mile beyond the draw the trail forked, and Stratton
took the left-hand branch. The grazing hereabouts
was poor, and at this time of year particularly
the Shoe-Bar cattle were more likely to be confined
to the richer fenced-in pastures belonging to the ranch.
The scenery thus presenting no points of interest,
Buck&#8217;s thoughts turned to the interview ahead of him.
Marshaling his facts, he planned briefly how he would
make use of them, and finally began to draw scrappy
mental pen-pictures of the usurping Mary Thorne.</p>
<p>She would be tall, probably, and raw-boned&mdash;that
domineering, &#8220;bossy&#8221; type he always associated with
women who assumed men&#8217;s jobs&mdash;harsh-voiced and
more than a trifle hard. He dwelt particularly on
her hardness, for surely no other sort of woman could
possibly have helped to engineer the crooked deal which
Andrew Thorne and his daughter had so successfully
put across. She would be painfully plain, of course,
and doubtless also would wear knickerbockers like
a certain woman farmer he had once met in Texas,
smoke cigarettes constantly, and pack a gun. Having
endowed the lady with a few other disagreeable qualities
which pleased him mightily, Buck awoke to the
realization that he was approaching the eastern extremity
of the Shoe-Bar ranch. His eyes brightened, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
dismissing all thoughts of Miss Thorne, he began to
cast interested, appraising glances to right and left as
he rode.</p>
<p>There is little that escapes the eye of the professional
ranchman, especially when he has been absent from his
property for more than two years. Buck Stratton observed
quite as much as the average man, and it presently
became evident that what he saw did not please
him. His keen eyes sought out sagging fence-wire
where staples, drawn or fallen out, had never been replaced.
Here and there a rotting post leaned at a
precarious angle, or gates between pastures needed
repairing badly. What cattle were in sight seemed in
good condition but their number was much less than
he expected. Only once did he observe any signs of
human activity, and then the loafing attitude of the
two punchers riding leisurely through a field half a mile
away was but too apparent. By the time he came
within sight of the ranch-house, nestling pleasantly
in a little grove of cottonwoods beyond the creek,
his face was set in a hard scowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me like they were letting the whole outfit
go to pot,&#8221; he muttered angrily. &#8220;It sure is time I
whirled in and took a hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urging the roan forward, he rode splashing through
the shallow stream, up the gentle slope, and swung out
of his saddle close to the kitchen door. This stood
open, and striding up to it Buck met the languid gaze
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
of a swarthy middle-aged Mexican who lounged just
within the portal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Thorne around?&#8221; he asked curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; shrugged the Mexican. &#8220;I t&#8217;ink she in
fron&#8217; house. Yoh try aroun&#8217; other door, mebbe fin&#8217;
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the old days the kitchen entrance had been the one
most used, but Buck remembered that there was another
at the opposite end of the building which opened
directly into the ranch living-room. He sought it
now, observing with preoccupied surprise that a small
covered veranda had been built out from the house,
found it ajar like the other, and knocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said a voice.</p>
<p>Stratton crossed the threshold, instinctively removing
his hat. As he remembered it, the room, though
of good size and comfortable enough, had been a
clutter of purely masculine belongings. He was quite
unprepared for the colorful gleam of Navajo rugs, the
curtained windows, the general air of swept and garnished
tidiness which seemed almost luxury. Briefly
his sweeping glance took in a bowl of flowers on the
center-table and then came to rest abruptly on a slight,
girlish figure just risen from a chair beside it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see Miss Thorne, please,&#8221; he said,
stifling his momentary surprise.</p>
<p>The girl took a step forward, her slim, tanned, ringless
fingers clasped loosely about a book she held.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Miss Thorne,&#8221; she answered in a low, pleasant
voice.</p>
<p>Buck gasped and his eyes widened. Then he recovered
himself swiftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean Miss Mary Thorne,&#8221; he explained; &#8220;the&mdash;er&mdash;owner
of this outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl smiled faintly, a touch of veiled wistfulness
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mary Thorne,&#8221; she said quietly. &#8220;There&#8217;s
only one, you know.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE BRANDING-IRON</h3>
</div>

<p>Stratton was never sure just how long he stood
staring at her in dumb, dazed bewilderment.
After those mental pictures of the Mary Thorne he
had expected to find, it was small wonder that the
sight of this slip of a black-frocked girl, with her soft
voice, her tawny-golden hair and wistful eyes, should
stun him into temporary speechlessness. Even when
he finally pulled himself together to feel a hot flush
flaming in his face and find one gloved hand recklessly
crumpling his new Stetson, he could not quite credit
the evidence of his hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I beg pardon,&#8221; he said stiffly. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t
seem possible that&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated. The girl&#8217;s smile deepened whimsically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she said ruefully. &#8220;It never does.
Nobody seems to think a girl can seriously attempt
to run a cattle-ranch&mdash;even the way I&#8217;m trying to run
it, with a capable foreman to look after things. Sometimes
I wonder if&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, her glance falling on the book she held.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Stratton saw that it was a shabby account-book, a
stubby pencil thrust between the leaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; he prompted, scarcely aware what made
him ask the question.</p>
<p>She looked up at him, her eyes a little wider than before.
They were a warm hazel, and for an instant
in their depths Stratton glimpsed a troubled expression,
so veiled and swiftly passing that a moment later
he could not be sure he had read aright.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; she shrugged. &#8220;You probably know
what a lot of nagging little worries a ranchman has,
and sometimes it seems to me they all have to come at
once. I suppose even a man gets a bit discouraged,
now and then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure does,&#8221; agreed Buck. &#8220;What&mdash;er&mdash;particular
sort of worry do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>He asked the question impulsively without realizing
how it might sound, coming from a total stranger.
The girl&#8217;s slim figure stiffened and her chin went up.
Then&mdash;perhaps something in his expression told her
he had not meant to be impertinent&mdash;her face cleared.</p>
<p>&#8220;The principal one is lack of help,&#8221; she explained
readily enough, and yet Stratton got a curious impression,
somehow, that this wasn&#8217;t really the worst
of her troubles. &#8220;We&#8217;re awfully short-handed.&#8221;
She hesitated an instant and then went on frankly,
&#8220;To tell the truth, when you first came in I was hoping
you might be looking for a job.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>For an instant Buck had all he could do to conceal
his amazement at this extraordinary turn of events.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean I&#8217;d stand a chance of being taken on?&#8221;
he countered, sparring for time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! That is&mdash;You are a cow-puncher,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton&#8217;s lips twitched slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked around cattle all my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then naturally it would be all right. I should
be very glad to hire you. Tex Lynch usually looks
after all that, but he&#8217;s away this afternoon and there&#8217;s
no reason why I shouldn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221; Her quaint air of
dignity was marred by a sudden, amused twitch of the
lips. &#8220;I&#8217;m really awfully pleased you did come to
me,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;He&#8217;s been telling me for over two
weeks that he couldn&#8217;t hire a man for love or money;
it&#8217;ll be amusing to show him what I&#8217;ve done, sitting
quietly here at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all settled, then?&#8221; Stratton had been doing
some rapid thinking. &#8220;You&#8217;d like me to start in
right away, I suppose? That&#8217;ll suit me fine. My
name&#8217;s Bob Green. If you&#8217;ll just explain to Lynch
that I&#8217;m hired, I&#8217;ll go down to the bunk-house and he
can put me to work when he comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a slight bow, he was moving away when Miss
Thorne stopped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Why, you haven&#8217;t said a word
about wages.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>Buck turned back, biting his lip and inwardly
cursing himself for his carelessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;posed it would be the usual forty dollars,&#8221; he
explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;We pay that for new hands,&#8221; the girl informed
him in some surprise. She sat down beside the table
and opened her book. &#8220;I can put you down for forty,
I suppose, and then Tex will tell me what it
ought to be after he&#8217;s seen you work. Green, did
you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert Green.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the address?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck scratched his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t guess I&#8217;ve got any,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;I used
to punch cows in Texas, but I&#8217;ve been away two
years and a half, and the last outfit I was with has
sold out to farmers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She looked up swiftly and her gaze leaped
unerringly to the scar which showed below his tumbled
hair. &#8220;Oh! I see. You&mdash;you&#8217;ve been through
the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice broke a little, and to Buck&#8217;s astonishment
she turned quite white as her eyes sought the
book again. A sudden fear smote him that she had
guessed his real identity, but he dismissed the notion
quickly. Such a thing was next to impossible when
she had never set eyes upon him before to-day.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all, I think,&#8221; she said presently in a low
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
voice. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find the bunk-house, at the foot of
the slope beside the creek. I&#8217;ll speak to Tex as soon
as he comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside the ranch house, Buck paused for a moment
or two, ostensibly to stare admiringly at a carefully
tended flower-bed, but in reality to adjust his
mind to the new and extraordinary situation. During
the last two hours he had speculated a good deal
on this interview, but not even his wildest imaginings
had pictured the turn it had actually taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hired as a puncher on my own ranch by the girl
whose father stole it from me!&#8221; he murmured under
his breath. &#8220;It&#8217;s a scream! Darned if it wouldn&#8217;t
make a good vaudeville turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as he walked slowly back to where he had left
his horse, Stratton&#8217;s face grew thoughtful. He was
trying to analyze the motives which had prompted
him to accept such a position and found them a trifle
mixed. Undeniably the girl&#8217;s unexpected personality
influenced him considerably. She did not strike him,
even remotely, as the sort who would deliberately do
anything dishonest. And though Buck knew there
were women who might be able to assume that air of
almost childlike innocence, he did not believe, somehow,
that in her case it was assumed. At any rate a little
delay would do no harm. By accepting the proffered
job he would be able to study the lady and the situation
at his leisure. Also&mdash;and this he told himself was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
even more important&mdash;he would have a chance of
quietly investigating conditions on the ranch. Pop
Daggett&#8217;s vague hints, his own observations, and the
intuition he had that Miss Thorne was worrying
about something much more vital than the mere lack
of hands, all combined to make him feel that things
were not going right at the Shoe-Bar. Of course it
might be simply a case of rotten management. But
in the back of Buck&#8217;s mind there lurked a curious notion
that something deeper and more far-reaching was
going on beneath the surface, though of what nature
he could not even guess.</p>
<p>Leading the roan into a corral which ranged beyond
the kitchen, Stratton unsaddled him and turned
him loose. Having hung the saddle and bridle in the
adjacent shed, he tucked his bundle under one arm
and headed for the bunk-house. He was within a few
yards of the entrance to the long, adobe structure
when the door was suddenly flung open and a slim,
slight figure, hatless and stripped to the waist, plunged
out, closely pursued by three other men.</p>
<p>He ran blindly with head down, and Buck had just
time to drop his bundle and extend both arms to prevent
a collision. An instant later his tense muscles quivered
under the impact of some hundred and thirty pounds
of solid bone and muscle; the runner staggered and
flung up his head, a gasp of terror jolted from his
lips.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he said more quietly, his tone an equal blend
of astonishment and relief. &#8220;I thought&mdash;Don&#8217;t let
&#8217;em&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off, flushing. He was a pleasant-faced
youngster of not more than eighteen or nineteen, with
a tangled mop of blonde hair and blue eyes, the pupils
of which were curiously dilated. Stratton, whose
extended arms had caught the boy just under the armpits,
could feel his heart pounding furiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, kid?&#8221; he asked briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were going to brand me&mdash;on the back,&#8221; the
boy muttered.</p>
<p>Over the fellow&#8217;s bare, muscular shoulders Buck&#8217;s
glance swept the trio who had pulled up just outside
the bunk-house door. They seemed typical cow-punchers
in dress and manner. Two of them were tall
and well set up; the third was short and stocky and
held a branding iron in one hand. Meeting Stratton&#8217;s
gaze, he laughed loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;By cripes, Bud! Yuh shore are easy. I thought
yuh had more guts than to be scared of an iron that&#8217;s
hardly had the chill took off.&#8221;</p>
<p>He guffawed again, the other two joining in. A
flush crept up into the boy&#8217;s face, but his lips were firm
now, and as he turned to face the others his eyes
narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s so cold as that mebbe you&#8217;d like me to try
it on yuh,&#8221; he suggested significantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>The short man haw-hawed again, but not quite so
boisterously. Buck noticed that he held the branding iron
carefully away from his leg.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shore wouldn&#8217;t hollar like you done &#8217;fore I was
touched,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;Wal, we got his goat good
that time, didn&#8217;t we, Butch? Better come in an&#8217; git
yore shirt on &#8217;fore the boss sees yuh half naked.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and disappeared into the bunk-house,
followed by the two other punchers. Buck picked
up his bundle and glanced at the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like you&#8217;ve got a right sociable, amusing
bunch around here,&#8221; he drawled.</p>
<p>The youngster&#8217;s lips parted impulsively, to close
as swiftly over his white teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re a great lot of jokers,&#8221; he returned
non-committally, moving toward the door. &#8220;Coming
in?&#8221;</p>
<p>The room they entered was long and rather narrow,
with built-in bunks occupying most of the wall space,
while the usual assemblage of bridles, ropes, old hats,
and garments, hanging from pegs, crowded the remainder.
Opposite the door stood a rusty, pot-bellied
stove which gave forth a heat that seemed rather
superfluous on such a warm evening. The stocky
fellow, having leaned his branding-iron against the
adobe chimney, was occupied in closing the drafts.
His two companions, both rolling cigarettes, stood beside
him, while lounging at a rough table to the left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
of the door sat two other men, one of them idly shuffling
a pack of dirty cards. As he entered, Stratton
was conscious of the intent scrutiny of all five, and an
easy, careless smile curved his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon this is the bunk-house, all right,&#8221; he
drawled. &#8220;The lady told me it was down this way.
My name&#8217;s Bob Green&mdash;Buck for short. I&#8217;ve just
been hired to show you guys how to punch cows
proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a barely perceptible silence, broken by
one of the men at the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hired?&#8221; he repeated curtly. &#8220;Why, I thought
Tex went to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tex?&#8221; queried Stratton. &#8220;Oh, you mean the
foreman. The lady did say something about that
when she signed me up. Said she&#8217;d tell him about
it when he came back.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was aware of a swift exchange of glances between
several of the men. The stocky fellow suddenly
abandoned his manipulation of the stove-dampers and
came forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it?&#8221; he remarked with an amiable grin.
&#8220;Tex most always does the hirin&#8217;, yuh see. Glad to
know yuh. My name&#8217;s McCabe&mdash;Slim, they calls
me, &#8217;count uh my sylph-like figger. These here guys
is Bill Joyce an&#8217; his side-kick, Butch Siegrist; likewise
Flint Kreeger an&#8217; Doc Peters over to the table.
Bud Jessup yuh already met.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>He chuckled, and Buck glancing toward the corner
where the youngster was tucking in the tails of his
flannel shirt, smiled slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got acquainted kinda sudden, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221; he
grinned. &#8220;Glad to meet you gents. Whereabouts
is a bunk I can stake my claim to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This here&#8217;s vacant,&#8221; spoke up Bud Jessup quickly,
indicating one next to his own.</p>
<p>Buck stepped over and tossed his bundle into it. As
he did so the raucous clanging of a bell sounded from
the direction of the ranch-house, accompanied by a
stentorian shout: &#8220;Grub-pile!&#8221; which galvanized the
punchers into action.</p>
<p>Stratton and the boy were the last to leave the room,
and as he reached the door Buck noticed a tiny wisp
of smoke curling up from the floor to one side of the
stove. Looking closer he saw that it was caused by
the branding-iron, one corner of which rested on the
end of a board where the rough flooring came in contact
with the square of hard-packed earth beneath the
stove. Bud Jessup saw it, too, and without comment
he stepped over and moved the iron to a safer
position.</p>
<p>Still without words, the two left the bunk-house.
But as they headed for the kitchen Buck&#8217;s eyes narrowed
slightly and he flashed a momentary glance at
his companion which was full of curiosity and
thoughtful speculation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TEX LYNCH</h3>
</div>

<p>Supper, which was served in the ranch-house kitchen
by Pedro, the Mexican cook, was not enlivened
by much conversation. The food was plentiful
and of good quality, and the punchers addressed themselves
to its consumption with the single-hearted purpose
of hungry men whose appetites have been sharpened
by a long day in the saddle. Now and then someone
mumbled a request to &#8220;pass the sugar,&#8221; or desired
more steak or coffee from the shuffling Pedro; but
for the most part the serious business of eating occupied
them exclusively.</p>
<p>There was no sign of Miss Thorne. Buck decided
that she took her meals elsewhere and approved the
isolation. It must be pretty hard, he thought, for
a girl like that to be living her young life in this out-of-the-way
corner of the world with no women companions
to keep her company. Then he remembered
that for all he knew she might not be the only one of
her sex on the Shoe-Bar, and when the meal was over
and the men were straggling back toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
bunk-house, he put the question to Bud Jessup, who walked
beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; grunted the youngster, with a sharp, inquiring
glance at his face. &#8220;What d&#8217;yuh want to know
that for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;No particular
reason,&#8221; he smiled. &#8220;I only thought she&#8217;d find it
mighty dull alone on the ranch with a bunch of
punchers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud continued to eye him intently. &#8220;Well, she ain&#8217;t
alone,&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;Mrs. Archer lives with her;
an&#8217; uh course there&#8217;s Pedro&#8217;s Maria.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Mrs. Archer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her aunt. Kinda nice old lady, but she ain&#8217;t got
much pep. Maria&#8217;s jest the other way. When she&#8217;s
got a grouch on she&#8217;s some cat, believe me!&#8221;</p>
<p>For some reason the subject appeared to be distasteful
to Jessup, and Buck asked no more questions.
Instead of following the others into the bunk-house
they strolled on along the bank of the creek, which
was lined with fair-sized cottonwoods. The sun had
set, but the glow of it still lingered in the west. Glinting
like a flame on the windows of the ranch-house,
it even dappled the placid waters of the little stream
with red-gold splotches, which mingled effectively with
the mirrored reflections of the overhanging trees.
From the kitchen chimney a wisp of smoke rose
straight into the still clear air. In a corner of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
corral half a dozen horses were bunched, lazily switching
their tails at intervals. Through one of the pastures
across the stream some cattle drifted, idly feeding
their way to water.</p>
<p>It was a peaceful picture, yet Stratton could not
rid his mind of the curious feeling that the peacefulness
was all on the surface. He had not missed that
swift exchange of glances that heralded his first
appearance in the bunk-house; and though Slim
McCabe particularly had been almost effusively affable,
Buck was none the less convinced that his presence
here was unwelcome. That business of the
branding-iron, too, was puzzling. Was it merely a
bit of rough but harmless horse-play or had it a
deeper meaning? Bud did not look like a fellow to
lose his nerve easily, and the iron had certainly been
hot enough to brand even the tough hide of a three-year-old
steer.</p>
<p>Buck glanced sidewise at his companion to find
the blue eyes studying his face with a keen, questioning
scrutiny. They were hastily withdrawn, and a faint
color crept up, darkening the youngster&#8217;s tan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to size me up,&#8221; thought Stratton interestedly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got something on his chest, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he gave no sign of what was in his mind. A
moment or two later he paused and, leaning indolently
against a tree, let his gaze sweep idly over the cattle
in the near-by pasture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me like a pretty good bunch of steers,&#8221;
he commented, and then added carelessly: &#8220;What sort
of a guy is this Tex Lynch, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud hesitated briefly, sending a swift, momentary
glance toward the bunk-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s all right, I guess,&#8221; he answered slowly.</p>
<p>Stratton grinned. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t look out you&#8217;ll be
overpraising him, kid,&#8221; he chuckled.</p>
<p>Jessup shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I
liked him,&#8221; he defended. &#8220;He knows his business
all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure. Otherwise, I s&#8217;pose he wouldn&#8217;t hold
down his job. But what I want to know is the kind
of boss he is. Does he treat the fellows white, or is
he a sneak?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;He treats some of &#8217;em
white enough,&#8221; he snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;That so? Favorites, eh? I&#8217;ve met up with that
kind before. Is he hard to get on the right side of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno,&#8221; growled the youngster. &#8220;I never tried.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck chuckled again. &#8220;Well, kid, so long as you
don&#8217;t seem to think it&#8217;s worth while, I dunno why I
should take the trouble. Who else is on the outs with
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessup flashed a startled glance at him. &#8220;How in
blazes do you know&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, gosh! That&#8217;s easy. That open-faced countenance
of yours would give you away even if your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
tongue didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d say you weren&#8217;t a bit in love
with Lynch, or any of the rest of the bunch, either.
Likely you got a good reason, an&#8217; of course it ain&#8217;t any
of my business; but if that stunt with the red-hot
branding-iron is a sample of their playfulness, I should
think you&#8217;d drift. There must be plenty of peaceful
jobs open in the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s just what they want me to do,&#8221; snapped
Jessup hotly. &#8220;They&#8217;re doin&#8217; their best to drive
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His jaws clamped shut and a sudden suspicion
flashed into his eyes, which caused Buck promptly to
relinquish all hope of getting any further information
from the boy. Evidently he had said the wrong
thing and got the fellow&#8217;s back up, though he could
not imagine how. And so, when Jessup curtly proposed
that they return to the bunk-house, Stratton
readily acquiesced.</p>
<p>They found the five punchers gathered around the
table playing draw-poker under the light of a flaring
oil lamp. McCabe extended a breezy invitation to
Buck to join them, which he accepted promptly, drawing
up an empty box to a space made for him between
Slim and Butch Siegrist. With scarcely a glance at
the group, Jessup selected a tattered magazine from a
pile in one corner and sprawled out on his bunk, first
lighting a small hand lamp and placing it on the floor
beside him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>Stratton liked poker and played a good game, but
he soon discovered that he was up against a pretty
stiff proposition. The limit was the sky, and Kreeger
and McCabe especially seemed to have a run of phenomenal
luck. Buck didn&#8217;t believe there was anything
crooked about their playing; at least he could
detect no sign of it, though he kept a sharp lookout
as he always did when sitting in with strangers. But
he was rather uncomfortably in a hole and was just
beginning to realize rather whimsically that for a
while at least he had only a cow-man&#8217;s pay to depend
on for spending-money, when the door was suddenly
jerked open and a tall, broad-shouldered figure loomed
in the opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all right, fellows,&#8221; said the new-comer,
blinking a little at the light. &#8220;I saw&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught himself up abruptly and glowered at
Stratton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the devil are yuh?&#8221; he inquired harshly,
stepping into the room.</p>
<p>Buck met his hard glance with smiling amiability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Name of Buck Green,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;Passed you
on the trail this afternoon, didn&#8217;t I? You must be
Tex Lynch.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a scarcely perceptible movement he shifted
his cards to his left hand. His right, the palm half
open, rested on the edge of the table just above his
thigh. He didn&#8217;t really believe the foreman would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
start anything, but one never knew, especially with
a man of such evidently uncertain temper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted Lynch. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t yuh stop me
then? Yuh might have saved yourself a ride.&#8221; He
continued to stare at Stratton, a veiled speculation in
his smoldering eyes. &#8220;Well?&#8221; he went on impatiently.
&#8220;What can I do for yuh now I&#8217;m here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck raised his eyebrows. &#8220;Do for me? Why,
I don&#8217;t know as there&#8217;s anything right this minute.
I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ll be wanting to put me to work in the
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve sure got nerve a-plenty,&#8221; rasped the foreman.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t hirin&#8217; anybody that comes along just
because he wears chaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; drawled Buck. &#8220;Funny the lady didn&#8217;t
mention that when she signed me up this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynch&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;Yuh mean to say&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused abruptly, his angry eyes sweeping past
Stratton, to rest for an instant on Flint Kreeger, who
sat just beyond McCabe. What he saw there Buck
did not know, but it must have been something of
warning or information. When his eyes returned
to Stratton their expression was veiled under drooping
lids; his lithe figure relaxed into an easier position
against the door-casing, both hands resting lightly on
slim hips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Thorne hired yuh, then?&#8221; he remarked in a
non-committal voice which yet held no touch of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
friendliness. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s different. Where&#8217;ve yuh
worked?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last outfit was the Three-Circles in Texas.&#8221;
Buck named at random an outfit in the southern part
of the state with which he was slightly acquainted.
&#8220;Been in the army over two years, and just got my
discharge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Texas?&#8221; repeated Lynch curtly. &#8220;How the devil
do yuh happen to be lookin&#8217; for work here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d heard Joe Bloss was foreman,&#8221; explained Buck
calmly. &#8220;We used to work together on the Three-Circles,
and I knew he&#8217;d give me a job. When I
found out in Paloma he&#8217;d gone, I took a chance an&#8217;
rode out anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bore the foreman&#8217;s searching scrutiny very well,
without a change of color or the quiver of an eyelash.
Nevertheless he was not a little relieved when Lynch,
with a brief comment about trying him out in the
morning, moved around the table and sat down on a
bunk to pull off his chaps. That sudden and complete
bottling up of emotion had shown Buck how
much more dangerous the man was than he had supposed,
and he was pleased enough to come out of their
first encounter so well.</p>
<p>With a barely perceptible sense of relaxing tension,
the poker game was resumed, for which Buck was
devoutly thankful. Throughout the interruption he
had not forgotten his hand, which was by far the best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
he had held that evening. He played it and the
succeeding ones so well that when the game ended
he had managed to break even.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the lights were out, and the
silence of the bunk-house was broken only by the regular
breathing of eight men, or the occasional creak
of some one shifting his position in the narrow bunk.
Having no blankets&mdash;a deficiency he meant to remedy
if he could get off long enough to-morrow to ride to
Paloma Springs&mdash;Buck removed merely chaps and
boots and stretched his long form on the corn-husk
tick with a little sigh of weariness. Until this moment
he had not realized how tired he was. But he had
slept poorly on the train, and this, coupled with the
heady air and the somewhat stirring events of the
last few hours, dragged his eyelids shut almost as soon
as his head struck the improvised pillow.</p>
<p>It seemed as if scarcely a moment had passed before
he opened them again. But he knew that it must be
several hours later, for it had been pitch-dark when
he went to sleep, and now a square of moonlight lay
across the floor under the southern window, bringing
into faint relief the outlines of the long room.</p>
<p>Just what had roused him he did not know; some
noise, no doubt, either inside the bunk-house or without.
Nerves attuned to battle-front conditions are
likely to become sharp as razor-edges, and Buck, starting
from deep slumber to complete wakefulness, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
almost instantly aware of a sense of strangeness in
his surroundings.</p>
<p>In a moment he knew what it was. Even though
they may not snore, the breathing of seven sleeping
men is unmistakable. Buck did not have to strain his
ears to realize that not a sound came from any of the
other bunks, and swiftly the utter, unnatural stillness
became oppressive.</p>
<p>Quietly he swung his stockinged feet to the floor and
was reaching for the holster and cartridge-belt he had
laid beside him, when, from the adjoining bunk, Bud
Jessup&#8217;s voice came in a cautious whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gone. The whole bunch of &#8217;em just rode
off.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE BLOOD-STAINED SADDLE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hello, kid!&#8221; said Stratton quietly. &#8220;You
awake? What&#8217;s up, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a rustle in the adjoining bunk, the thud
of bare feet on the floor, and Jessup&#8217;s face loomed,
wedge-shaped and oddly white, through the shadows.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gone,&#8221; he repeated, with a curious, nervous
hesitancy of manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. You said that before. What the devil
are they doing out this time of night?&#8221;</p>
<p>In drawing his weapon to him, Buck&#8217;s eyes had
fallen on his wrist-watch, the radiolite hands of which
indicated twenty minutes after twelve. He awaited
Jessup&#8217;s reply with interest, and it struck him as unnaturally
long in coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t rightly know,&#8221; the youngster said at length.
&#8220;I s&#8217;pose they must have gone out after&mdash;the rustlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck straightened abruptly. &#8220;What!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;You mean to say there&#8217;s been rustling on
the Shoe-Bar?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Jessup hesitated, but more briefly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know why I shouldn&#8217;t tell yuh. Everybody&#8217;s wise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
to it, or suspects somethin&#8217;. They&#8217;ve got away with
quite a bunch&mdash;mostly from the pastures around Las
Vegas, over near the hills. Tex says they&#8217;re greasers,
but I think&mdash;&#8221; He broke off to add a moment later
in a troubled tone, &#8220;I wish to thunder he hadn&#8217;t gone
an&#8217; left Rick out there all alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton remembered Las Vegas as the name of a
camp down at the southwesterly extremity of the
ranch. It consisted of a one-room adobe shack, which
was occupied at certain seasons of the year by one or
two punchers, who from there could more easily look
after the near-by cattle, or ride fence, than by going
back and forth every day from the ranch headquarters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Rick?&#8221; he asked briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rick Bemis. He&mdash;he&#8217;s one dandy fellow. We&#8217;ve
worked together over two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m. How long&#8217;s this rustling been going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three or four months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lost many head, have they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a bunch, I&#8217;d say, but I don&#8217;t know. They
never tell me or Rick anythin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud&#8217;s tone was bitter, and Stratton noticed it in
spite of his preoccupation. Rustling! That would
account for several of the things that had puzzled him.
Rustling was possible, too, with the border-line comparatively
near, and that stretch of rough, hilly country
which touched the lower extremity of the ranch. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
for the stealing to go on for three or four months,
without something drastic being done to stop it, seemed
peculiar, to say the least.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s been done about it?&#8221; Buck asked briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ve gone out at night a few times, but
they never caught anybody that I heard. Seems like
the thieves were too slick, or else&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused; Buck regarded him curiously through
the faintly luminous shadows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he prodded</p>
<p>Bud moved uneasily. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t anythin&#8217; special,&#8221;
he returned evasively. &#8220;All this time they never left
anybody down to Las Vegas till Rick was sent day
before yesterday. I up an&#8217; told Tex straight out
there&#8217;d oughta be another fellow with him, but all he
done was to bawl me out an&#8217; tell me to mind my own
business. It ain&#8217;t safe, an&#8217; now they&#8217;ve gone out&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he broke off, his voice a trifle husky with
emotion. He was evidently growing more and more
worked up and alarmed for the safety of his friend.
It was plain, too, that the recent departure of the punchers
for the scene of action, instead of reassuring
Bud, had greatly increased his anxiety. Buck decided
that the situation wasn&#8217;t as simple as it looked,
and promptly determined on a little action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it ease your mind any if we saddled up an&#8217;
followed the bunch?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>Jessup drew a quick breath and half rose from the
bunk. &#8220;By cripes, yes!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Yuh mean
you&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Stratton, reaching for his boots.
&#8220;Why not? If there&#8217;s going to be any excitement I&#8217;d
like to be on hand. Pile into your clothes, kid, and
let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessup began to dress rapidly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose
Tex&#8217;ll be awful pleased,&#8221; he murmured, dragging
on his shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see he&#8217;ll have any kick coming,&#8221; returned
Buck easily. &#8220;If he&#8217;s laying for rustlers, seems like
he&#8217;d ought to have routed out the two of us in the
beginning to have as big a crowd as possible. You
never know what you&#8217;re up against with those slippery
cusses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud made no further comment, and a few minutes
later they left the bunk-house and went up to the
corral. The bright moonlight illumined everything
clearly and made it easy to rope and saddle two of
the three horses remaining in the enclosure. Then,
swinging into the saddle, they rode down the slope,
splashed through the creek, and entering the further
pasture by a gate, headed south at a brisk lope.</p>
<p>The land comprising the Shoe-Bar ranch was a
roughly rectangular strip, much longer than it was
wide, which skirted the foothills of the Escalante
Mountains. As the crow flies it was roughly seven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
miles from the ranch-house to Las Vegas camp, and for
the better part of that distance there was little conversation
between the two riders. Buck would have liked
to question his companion about a number of things
that puzzled him, but having sized up Jessup and come
to the conclusion that the youngster was the sort whose
confidence must be given uninvited or not at all, he
held his peace. Apparently Bud had not yet made up
his mind whether to class Stratton as an enemy or a
friend, and Buck felt he could not do better than endeavor
unobtrusively to impress the latter fact upon
him. That done, he was sure the boy would open
up freely.</p>
<p>The wisdom of this policy became evident sooner
than he expected. From time to time as they rode,
Stratton commented casually, as a new hand would
be likely to do, on some feature or other connected
with the ranch or their fellow-punchers. To these
remarks Jessup replied readily enough, but in a preoccupied
manner, until all at once, moved either by
something Buck had said, or possibly by a mind burdened
to the point where self-restraint was no longer
possible, he burst into sudden surprising speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t no foolin&#8217; with that iron this afternoon.
If yuh hadn&#8217;t come along jest then they&#8217;d
of branded me on the back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Astonished, Buck glanced at him sharply. They had
traveled more than two-thirds of the distance to Las
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Vegas camp, and he had quite given up hope of Jessup&#8217;s
opening up during the ride.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, say!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Are you trying to throw
a load into me? Why would they want to do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessup gave a short brittle laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want me to quit,&#8221; he retorted curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit?&#8221; repeated Stratton, his eyes widening.
&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tex don&#8217;t want me here,&#8221; broke in the youngster.
&#8220;For the last three months he&#8217;s tried all kinds of ways
to make me an&#8217; Rick take our time; but it won&#8217;t work.&#8221;
His lips pressed together firmly. &#8220;I promised Miss&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His words clipped off abruptly, as a single shot,
sharp and distinct, shattered the still serenity of the
night. It came from the south, from the direction of
Las Vegas. Buck flung up his head and pulled instinctively
on the reins. Jessup caught his breath with an
odd, whistling intake.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he gasped unevenly.</p>
<p>For a moment or two they sat motionless, listening
intently, Buck&#8217;s face a curious mixture of alertness
and surprise. Up to this moment he had taken the
whole business rather casually, with small expectation
that anything would come of it, but the sound of that
shot changed everything. Something was happening,
then, after all&mdash;something sinister, perhaps, and certainly
not far away. His eyes narrowed, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
no other sound followed that single report, he loosed
his reins and urged the roan to a gallop.</p>
<p>For perhaps half a mile the two plunged forward
amidst a silence that was broken only by the dull
thudding of their horses&#8217; hoofs and their own rapid
breathing. Then all at once Buck jerked his roan to
a standstill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one&#8217;s coming,&#8221; he warned briefly.</p>
<p>Straight ahead of them the moonlight lay across
the flat, rolling prairie almost like a pathway of molten
silver. On either side of the brilliant stretch the light
merged gradually and imperceptibly into shadows&mdash;shadows
which yet held a curious, half-luminous quality,
giving a sense of shifting horizons and lending a
touch of mystery to the vague distances which seemed
to be revealed.</p>
<p>From somewhere in that illusive shadow land came
the faint beat of a horse&#8217;s hoofs, growing steadily
louder. Eyes narrowed to mere slits, Stratton stared
ahead intently until of a sudden his gaze focused on
a faintly visible moving shape.</p>
<p>He straightened, his right hand falling to the butt
of his Colt. But presently his grip relaxed and he
reached out slowly for his rope.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one on him,&#8221; he murmured in surprise.</p>
<p>Without turning his head, Jessup made an odd,
throaty sound of acquiescence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s saddled, though,&#8221; he muttered a moment
later, and also began taking down his rope.</p>
<p>Straight toward them along that moonlit pathway
came the flying horse, head down, stirrups of the
empty saddle flapping. Buck held his rope ready, and
when the animal was about a hundred feet away he
spurred suddenly to the right, whirling the widening
loop above his head. As it fell accurately about the
horse&#8217;s neck the animal stopped short with the mechanical
abruptness of the well-trained range mount and
stood still, panting.</p>
<p>Slipping to the ground, Bud ran toward him, with
Stratton close behind. The strange cayuse, a sorrel
of medium size, was covered with foam and lather,
and as Jessup came close to him he rolled his eyes
in a frightened manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Rick&#8217;s saddle,&#8221; said Bud in an agitated tone,
after he had made a hasty examination. &#8220;I&#8217;d know
it anywhere from&mdash;that&mdash;cut&mdash;in&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice trailed off into silence and he gazed with
wide-eyed, growing horror at the hand that had rested
on the saddle-skirt. It was stained bright crimson,
and Buck, staring over his shoulder, noticed that the
leather surface glistened darkly ominous in the bright
moonlight.</p>
<p>Slowly the boy turned his head and looked at Stratton.
His face was lint-white, and the pupils of his
eyes were curiously dilated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Rick&#8217;s saddle,&#8221; he repeated dully, and shuddered
as he stared again at his blood-stained hand.</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s own fingers caught the youngster&#8217;s shoulder
in a reassuring grip, and his lips parted. But before
he had time to speak a sudden volley of shots rang
out ahead of them, so crisp and distinct and clear that
instinctively he stiffened, his ears attuned for the familiar,
vibrant hum of flying bullets.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>RUSTLERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Swiftly the echoes of the shots died away, leaving
the still serenity of the night again unruffled.
For a moment or two Stratton waited expectantly;
then his shoulders squared decisively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s up to us to find out what&#8217;s going on
down there,&#8221; he said, turning toward his horse.</p>
<p>Jessup nodded curt agreement. &#8220;Better take the
sorrel along, hadn&#8217;t we?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Buck swung himself lightly into the
saddle, shortening the lead rope and fastening it to
the horn. &#8220;I was thinking of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five minutes later they pulled up in front of a small
adobe shack nestling against a background of cottonwoods
that told of the near presence of the creek.
The door stood open, framing a black rectangle which
proclaimed the emptiness of the hut, and with scarcely
a pause the two rode slowly on, searching the moonlit
vistas with keen alertness.</p>
<p>On their right the country had grown noticeably
rougher. Here and there low spurs from the near-by
western hills thrust out into the flat prairie, and deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
shadows which marked the opening of draw or gully
loomed up frequently. It was from one of these,
about half a mile south of the hut, that a voice issued
suddenly, halting the two riders abruptly by the curtness
of its snarling menace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck obeyed promptly, having learned from experience
the futility of trying to draw on a person
whose very outlines are invisible. Jessup&#8217;s hands went
up, too, and then dropped quickly to his sides again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Slim!&#8221; he cried, and spurred swiftly
toward the mouth of the gully. &#8220;What the deuce
is the matter?&#8221; he asked anxiously. &#8220;What&#8217;s happened
to Rick?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a momentary pause, and then McCabe
stepped out of the shadows, six-gun in one hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil are yuh doin&#8217; here?&#8221; he demanded
with a harshness which struck Buck in curious contrast
to his usual air of good humor. &#8220;Who&#8217;s that
with yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Green. We&mdash;we got worried, an&#8217; saddled
up an&#8217;&mdash;followed yuh. When we heard the shots&mdash;What
<i>did</i> happen to Rick, Slim? We caught his
horse out there, the saddle all&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since yuh gotta know,&#8221; snapped the puncher, &#8220;he
got a hole drilled through one leg. He&#8217;s right here
behind me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Bud flung himself out of the saddle and hurried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
over to the man lying just inside the gully, McCabe
stepped swiftly to the side of Stratton&#8217;s horse. There
was a mingling of doubt and sharp suspicion in the upturned
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh sure are up an&#8217; doin&#8217; for a new hand,&#8221; he commented
swiftly. &#8220;Was it yuh put it into his head to
come out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon maybe it was,&#8221; returned Buck easily.
&#8220;When we woke up an&#8217; found you all gone, the kid
got fretting considerable about his friend here, and
I didn&#8217;t see why we shouldn&#8217;t ride out and join you.
According to my mind, when you&#8217;re out after rustlers,
the more the merrier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! He told yuh we was after rustlers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Why not? It ain&#8217;t any secret, is it?
Leastwise, I didn&#8217;t gather that from Bud.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCabe&#8217;s face relaxed. &#8220;Wal, I dunno as &#8217;t is,&#8221; he
shrugged. &#8220;Tex likes to run things his own way,
though. Still, I dunno as there&#8217;s any harm done.
Truth is, we didn&#8217;t get started soon enough. We
was half a mile off when we heard the shot, an&#8217; rid
up to find Rick drilled through the leg an&#8217; the thieves
beatin&#8217; it for the mountains. The rest of the bunch
lit out after &#8217;em while I stayed with Rick. I dunno
as they caught any of &#8217;em, but I reckon they didn&#8217;t
have time to run off no cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton slid out of the saddle and threw the reins
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
over the roan&#8217;s head. He had not failed to notice
the slight discrepancy in McCabe&#8217;s statement as to
the length of time it took the punchers to ride from
the bunk-house to this spot, but he made no comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bemis hurt bad?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not serious. It&#8217;s a clean wound in his thigh.
I got it tied up with his neckerchief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck nodded and walked over to where Bud was
squatting beside the wounded cow-puncher. By this
time his eyes were accustomed to the half-darkness,
and he could easily distinguish the long length of the
fellow, and even noted that the dark eyes were regarding
him questioningly out of a white, rather
strained face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to look you over?&#8221; he asked, bending
down. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had considerable experience with this
sort of thing, and maybe I can make you easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it,&#8221; nodded the young chap briefly. &#8220;It
ain&#8217;t bleedin&#8217; like it was, but it could be a whole lot
more comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the aid of Jessup and McCabe, Bemis was
moved out into the moonlight, where Stratton made
a careful examination of his wound. He found that
the bullet had plowed through the fleshy part of the
thigh, just missing the bone, and, barring chances of
infection, it was not likely to be dangerous. He was
readjusting Slim&#8217;s crude bandaging when he heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
the beat of hoofs and out of the corner of one eye
saw McCabe walk swiftly out to meet the returning
punchers.</p>
<p>These halted about fifty feet away, and there was
a brief exchange of words of which Buck could distinguish
nothing. Presently two of the men dashed
off in the direction of the ranch-house, while Lynch
rode slowly forward and dismounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;How yuh feelin&#8217;?&#8221; he asked Bemis, adding with
a touch of sarcasm in his voice, &#8220;I hear yuh got a
reg&#8217;lar professional sawbones to look after yuh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He acts like he knew what he was about,&#8221; returned
Bemis briefly. &#8220;How yuh goin&#8217; to get me home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent Butch an&#8217; Flint after the wagon,&#8221; explained
Lynch. &#8220;They&#8217;ll hustle all they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you catch sight of the rustlers?&#8221; asked Stratton
suddenly.</p>
<p>The foreman flashed him a sudden not overfriendly
glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he returned curtly, and turning on his heel
led his horse over to where the others had gathered in
the shadow of a rocky butte.</p>
<p>It was nearly an hour before the lumbering farm-wagon
appeared. During the interval Buck sat beside
the wounded man, smoking and exchanging occasional
brief comments with Bud, who stayed close
by. One or two of the others strolled up to ask about
Bemis, but for the most part they remained in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
little group, the intermittent glow of their cigarettes
flickering in the darkness and the constant low murmur
of their conversation wafted indistinguishably across
the intervening space.</p>
<p>Their behavior piqued Buck&#8217;s curiosity tremendously.
What were they talking about so continually?
Where had the outlaws gone, and why hadn&#8217;t they
been pursued further? Had the whole pursuit been
merely in the nature of a bluff? And if so, whom
had it been intended to deceive? These and a score
of other questions passed through his mind as he sat
there waiting, but when the dull rumble of the wagon
started them all into activity, he had not succeeded
in finding any really plausible answers.</p>
<p>The return trip was necessarily slow, and dawn was
just breaking as they forded the creek and drove up
to the bunk-house. They had barely come to a standstill
when, to Buck&#8217;s surprise, the slim figure of Mary
Thorne, bare-headed and clad in riding-clothes,
appeared suddenly around the corner of the ranch-house
and came swiftly toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pedro told me,&#8221; she said briefly, pausing beside the
wagon. &#8220;How is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doin&#8217; fine,&#8221; responded Lynch promptly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
clean wound an&#8217; ought to heal in no time. Our new
hand Green tied him up like a regular professional.&#8221;</p>
<p>His manner was almost fulsomely pleasant; Miss
Thorne&#8217;s expression of anxiety relaxed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad. You&#8217;d better bring him right up
to the house; he&#8217;ll be more comfortable there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t hardly necessary,&#8221; objected Lynch.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll do all right here. We don&#8217;t want him to be
a bother to yuh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t be,&#8221; retorted Miss Thorne with unexpected
decision. &#8220;We&#8217;ve plenty of room, and
Maria has a bed all ready. The bunk-house is no
place for a sick man.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the brief colloquy Bemis, though perfectly
conscious, made no comment whatever. But Buck,
glancing toward him as he lay on the husk mattress
behind the driver, surprised a fleeting but unmistakable
expression of relief in his tanned face.</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t want to stay in the bunk-house,&#8221; thought
Stratton. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know as I blame him, neither. I
wonder, though, if it&#8217;s because he figures on being
more comfortable up there, or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The unvoiced question ended with a shrug as
Lynch, somewhat curt of manner, gave the order to
move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh don&#8217;t all of yuh have to come, neither,&#8221; he
added quickly. &#8220;Butch an&#8217; Slim an&#8217; me can carry him
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Thorne, who had already started toward the
house, glanced over one shoulder. &#8220;If Green knows
something about first aid, as you say, he&#8217;d better come
too, I think.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>Buck glanced questioningly at the foreman, received
a surly nod and dismounted, smiling inwardly. It
amused him exceedingly to see the dictatorial Tex
forced to take orders from this slip of a girl. Evidently
she was not quite so pathetically helpless as he
had supposed the afternoon before. He began to
wonder how she did it, for Lynch struck him as a far
from easy person to manage. He was still turning
the question over in his mind when he received a shock
which for the moment banished every other thought.</p>
<p>The wagon was backed up to the porch, and the
four punchers, each taking a corner of the mattress,
lifted Bemis out and carried him across the living-room
and through a door on the further side which
Miss Thorne held open. The room was light and
airy, and Buck was conscious of a vague sense of
familiarity, which he set down to his rather brief
acquaintance with the place two years ago. But when
Bemis had been undressed and put to bed and his
wound thoroughly cleansed with antiseptic and freshly
bandaged, Stratton, really looking about him for the
first time, made an odd discovery.</p>
<p>It was his own room! He remembered perfectly
choosing it and moving in his belongings the day before
he left; and as he stared curiously around he
could not see that a single one of them had been
touched. There were his trunks just as they had come
from Texas. His bureau stood between the windows,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
and on it lay a pair of brushes and the few odds and
ends he had left there when he enlisted. A pair of
chaps and a well-worn Stetson hung near the door,
and he had just stepped over to make sure they were
actually the ones he had left behind when Miss Thorne,
who had been talking in the living-room with Lynch,
appeared suddenly on the threshold.</p>
<p>As their glances met she drew herself up a little,
and a curious expression came into her eyes. Her
lips parted impulsively, but when, after a momentary
hesitation, she spoke, Buck had an impression that
something quite different had been on the tip of her
tongue an instant before.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better have the doctor at once, don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221; she said briefly.</p>
<p>Buck nodded. &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am, he ought. I&#8217;ve done
the best I could, and the chances are he&#8217;ll get along
all right; but a regular doctor ought to look him over
as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so. I&#8217;ve just told Tex to send a man to
town at once and wire Dr. Blanchard, who lives about
twelve miles up the line. It&#8217;ll take him three or four
hours to ride over, but there&#8217;s no one nearer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d let me go,&#8221; said Stratton impulsively.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to return the horse I borrowed and get
blankets and some things I left at the store. There&#8217;s
really nothing more I can do for Bemis by hanging
around.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>Her brows crinkled doubtfully. &#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re
sure&mdash;I suppose there&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t.
Tell Tex I said you were to go. He&#8217;ll give you the
directions. Only you&#8217;ll have to hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a murmured word of thanks, Buck snatched
up his hat and hastened into the living-room. As he
passed the big table he was aware of a door at the
farther end opening, but he did not turn his head.
An instant later, as he was in the act of springing
off the porch, he heard a woman&#8217;s voice behind him,
soft, low, and a little shaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Mary? What&#8217;s happened? You don&#8217;t
mean to tell me that&mdash;that another man&#8217;s been shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s eyes widened, but he did not pause. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the aunt, I reckon,&#8221; he muttered, as he sped down
the slope. His lips straightened. &#8220;Another! Holy
cats! What the devil am I up against, anyhow? A
murder syndicate?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE HOODOO OUTFIT</h3>
</div>

<p>Pop Daggett hesitated and glanced uneasily toward
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I warned yuh, didn&#8217;t I, the Shoe-Bar was a hoodoo
outfit?&#8221; he evaded.</p>
<p>Stratton shook some tobacco into a cigarette-paper
and jerked the draw-string with his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you did, but that&#8217;s not the question,&#8221; he
persisted. &#8220;I asked you if any other punchers had
met up with&mdash;accidents out there lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man continued to cock an eye on the store
entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since yuh gotta know,&#8221; he answered in a lowered
tone, &#8220;there was two. About three months ago Jed
Terry was scoutin&#8217; around back in the mountains, Lord
knows what fur, an&#8217; fell into a cañon an&#8217; broke his
skull. Four or five weeks arter that Sam Bennett was
plugged through the chest down below Las Vegas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Lynch happen to be with either of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir-ee,&#8221; returned Daggett hastily. &#8220;An&#8217; don&#8217;t
yuh go blattin&#8217; around I told yuh anythin&#8217; about it. I
ain&#8217;t one to gossip about my neighbors, more especially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Tex Lynch. Them two deaths&mdash; Say, Tex ain&#8217;t in
town with yuh, is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I know of. He certainly didn&#8217;t come
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! Wal, yuh never c&#8217;n tell with him. As I
was sayin&#8217;, Terry&#8217;s death was pernounced a accident,
an&#8217; they allowed Bennett was plugged by one of them
greaser rustlers I hear tell of. I ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; nothing
to the contrary. All I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; yuh is the Shoe-Bar
ain&#8217;t a healthy outfit to work for, an&#8217; this business
about Rick Bemis proves it. I wouldn&#8217;t sign on with
&#8217;em, not for a hundred a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck thrust the cigarette between his lips and felt
for a match. &#8220;Still I&#8217;ve got a mind to stick it out
a while,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;Accidents come in threes, they
say, so there won&#8217;t likely be another right soon. Well,
I reckon I&#8217;d better be traveling. How long will it
take that doctor man to get over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much longer than &#8217;t will yuh, if he was home
when yuh telephoned,&#8221; answered Daggett. &#8220;The railroad
takes a bend, an&#8217; Harpswell ain&#8217;t more than a
mile or two further from the Shoe-Bar than Paloma.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evidently Dr. Blanchard must have been at home,
for Buck had just finished unsaddling and was coming
away from the corral when he rode up. Stratton
took his horse and answered his brief questions as to
the accident, and then walked down to the bunk-house
with his blankets, tarp, and other belongings. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
place was empty, for it was after one o&#8217;clock and evidently
the men had gone off somewhere directly after
dinner. Indeed, Buck learned as much from Pedro
when he went back to forage for something to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;They go to move herd some place,&#8221; shrugged
the Mexican. &#8220;W&#8217;ere, I don&#8217; know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton ate his meal of beef, bread, and warmed-over
coffee in silence and then returned to the bunk-house,
vaguely dissatisfied at the idle afternoon which
stretched before him. Of course, Lynch had no way
of knowing when he would get back from town, but
it seemed to Buck that an up-and-doing foreman
would have left word for him to join them when he
did return.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless, of course, he don&#8217;t want me around,&#8221;
murmured Stratton. &#8220;Though for the life of me I
can&#8217;t see what he gains by keeping me idle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently it occurred to him that this might be a
good chance of pursuing some of the investigations
he had planned. Since noticing the disreputable condition
of the fence the afternoon of his arrival, he
had kept his eyes open, and a number of other little
signs had confirmed his suspicion that the ranch had
very much gone to seed. Of course this might be
merely the result of careless, slovenly methods on the
part of the foreman, and possibly it did not extend
to anything really radical. It would need a much
wider, more general inspection to justify a definite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
conclusion, and Stratton decided he might as well do
some of it this afternoon. On the plea of seeking
Lynch and the other men, he could ride almost anywhere
without exciting suspicion, and he at once left
the bunk-house to carry out his plan. Just outside the
door he met Dr. Blanchard.</p>
<p>&#8220;You made a good job of that dressing,&#8221; remarked
the older man briefly. He was tall with a slight stoop,
bearded, a little slovenly in dress, but with clear, level
eyes and a capable manner. &#8220;Where&#8217;d you learn
how?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton smiled. &#8220;Overseas. I was in the Transportation,
and we had to know a little of everything,
including first aid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum,&#8221; grunted the doctor. &#8220;Well, the kid&#8217;s doing
all right. I won&#8217;t have to come over again unless
fever develops.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they walked back to the hitching-rack, he gave
Buck a few directions about the care of the invalid.
There followed a slight pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re new here,&#8221; commented the doctor, untying
his bridle-reins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just came yesterday,&#8221; answered Stratton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend of Lynch?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s lips twitched. &#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; he shrugged.
&#8220;Miss Thorne hired me while he was in Paloma. I
got a notion he was rather peevish about it. Reckon
he prefers to pick his own hands.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>As the doctor swung into the saddle, his face momentarily
lightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that worry you,&#8221; he said, a faint little
twinkle in his eyes. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t good for anybody to
have their own way all the time. Well, you know
what to do about Bemis. If he shows any signs of
fever, get hold of me right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand he rode off. Stratton&#8217;s
glance followed him curiously. Had he really been
pleased to find that the new hand was not a friend of
Tex Lynch, or was the idea merely a product of Buck&#8217;s
imagination?</p>
<p>Still pondering, he turned abruptly to find Pedro
regarding him intently from the kitchen door. As
their glances met, the Mexican&#8217;s lids drooped and his
face smoothed swiftly into its usual indolent indifference;
but he was not quite quick enough to hide entirely
that first look of searching speculation mingled with
not a little venom.</p>
<p>Stratton&#8217;s own expression was the perfection of
studied self-control. He half smiled, and yawned in a
realistically bored manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure you don&#8217;t know where the bunch went?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting dead sick of hanging around
doing nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217; say,&#8221; shrugged the Mexican. &#8220;I wash
dishes an&#8217; don&#8217; see &#8217;em go. Mebbe back soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if they&#8217;re moving a herd&mdash;I don&#8217;t think!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
retorted Buck. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll ask Miss Thorne,&#8221; he
added, struck by a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, he walked briskly
along the front of the house toward the further entrance.
As he turned the corner he met the girl,
booted, spurred, her face shaded becomingly by a wide-brimmed
Stetson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just going to find you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Rick
wants to see you a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton followed her into the living-room, where
she paused and glanced back at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t met my aunt, Mrs. Archer,&#8221; she said
in her low, pleasant voice. &#8220;Auntie, this is Buck
Green, our new hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a chair beside one of the west windows, there
rose a little old lady at the sight of whom Buck&#8217;s eyes
widened in astonishment. Just what he had expected
Mrs. Archer to be he hardly knew, but certainly it
wasn&#8217;t this dainty, delicate, Dresden-China person
who came forward to greet him. Tiny she was, from
her old-fashioned lace cap to the tips of her small,
trim shoes. Her gown, of some soft gray stuff, with
touches of old lace here and there, was modishly cut
yet without any traces of exaggeration. Her abundant
white hair was beautifully arranged, and her
cheeks, amazingly soft and smooth, with scarcely a line
in them, were faintly pink. A more utterly incongruous
figure to find on an outlying Arizona ranch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
would be impossible to imagine, and Buck was hard put
to refrain from showing his surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Green?&#8221; she said in a soft
agreeable voice, which Stratton recognized at once
as the one he had overheard that morning. &#8220;My
niece has told me how helpful you&#8217;ve been already.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck took her outstretched hand gingerly, and
looked down into her upturned face. Her eyes were
blue, and very bright and eager, with scarcely a hint
of age in them. For a brief moment they gazed
steadily into his, searching, appraising, an underlying
touch of wistful anxiety in their clear depths. Then
a twinkle flashed into them and of a sudden Stratton
felt that he liked her very much indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad to meet you,&#8221; he said impulsively.</p>
<p>The smile spread from eyes to lips. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;I think I may say the same thing. I
hope you&#8217;ll like it here well enough to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a faint accent on the last word. Buck
noticed it, and after she had left them, saying she was
going to rest a little, he wondered. Did she want him
to remain merely because of the short-handed condition
of the ranch, or was there a deeper reason? He
glanced at Miss Thorne to find her regarding him
with something of the same anxious scrutiny he had
noticed in her aunt. Her gaze was instantly averted,
and a faint flush tinged her cheeks, to be reflected an
instant later in Stratton&#8217;s face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he said hurriedly, annoyed at his
embarrassment, &#8220;do you happen to know where the
men are? I thought I&#8217;d hunt them up. There&#8217;s no
sense in my hanging around all afternoon doing nothing.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re down at the south pasture,&#8221; she answered
readily. &#8220;Tex thinks it will be better to move the
cattle to where it won&#8217;t be so easy for those rustlers
to get at them. I&#8217;m just going down there and we
can ride together, if you like.&#8221; She turned toward
the door. &#8220;When you&#8217;re through with Rick you&#8217;ll
find me out at the corral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to saddle up for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pedro will do that, thank you. Tell Rick if he
wants anything while I&#8217;m gone all he has to do is to
ring the bell beside his bed and Maria will answer
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She departed, and Buck walked briskly into the bedroom.
Bemis lay in bed propped up with pillows and
looking much better physically than he had done that
morning. But his face was still strained, with that
harassed, worried expression about the eyes which
Stratton had noted before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh saw Doc Blanchard, didn&#8217;t yuh?&#8221; he asked,
as Buck sat down on the side of his bed. &#8220;What&#8217;d
he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that you were doing fine. Not a chance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
in a hundred, he said, of your having any trouble with
the wound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know that. But when&#8217;d he say I&#8217;d be on my
feet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t mention
any particular time for that. I should think it would
be two or three weeks, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; The young fellow&#8217;s fingers twisted the
coverlet nervously. &#8220;Don&#8217;t yuh believe I could&mdash;er&mdash;ride
before that?&#8221; he added, almost pleadingly.</p>
<p>Stratton&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;Ride!&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;Where the deuce do you want to ride to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bemis hesitated, a slow flush creeping into his tanned
face. The glance he bent on Stratton was somewhat
shamefaced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere,&#8221; he answered curtly, a touch of defiance
in his tone. &#8220;You&#8217;ll say I&#8217;ve lost my nerve, an&#8217;
maybe I have. But after what&#8217;s happened around this
joint lately, and especially last night&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, glancing nervously toward the door.
Buck&#8217;s expression had grown suddenly keen and eager.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he urged. &#8220;What did happen, anyhow?
I had my suspicions there was something queer about
that business, but&mdash;You can trust me, old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bemis nodded, his dark eyes searching Stratton&#8217;s
face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take a chance,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I got to.
There ain&#8217;t nobody else. They&#8217;ve kept Bud away,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
and Miss Mary&mdash;Well, she&#8217;s all right, uh course, but
Tex has got her buffaloed. She won&#8217;t believe nothin&#8217;
ag&#8217;in him. I told Bud I&#8217;d stay as long as he did,
but&mdash;A man&#8217;s got to look after himself some.
They ain&#8217;t likely to miss twice runnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to say&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bemis stopped him with a cautious gesture.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s that sneaking greaser?&#8221; he asked in a low
tone, his eyes shifting nervously to the open door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out saddling her horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Well, listen.&#8221; The young puncher&#8217;s voice
sank almost to a whisper. &#8220;That sendin&#8217; me down
to Las Vegas was a plant; I&#8217;m shore of it. My
orders was to sleep days an&#8217; patrol around nights to
get a line on who was after the cattle. I wasn&#8217;t awful
keen about it, but still an&#8217; all, I didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d
dare do what they tried to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean there weren&#8217;t any rustlers at all?&#8221; put
in Stratton impulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore there was, but they didn&#8217;t fire that shot
that winged me. I&#8217;d just got sight of &#8217;em four or
five hundred yards away an&#8217; was ridin&#8217; along in the
shadow tryin&#8217; to edge close enough to size &#8217;em up an&#8217;
mebbe pick off a couple. My cayuse was headin&#8217;
south, with the rustlers pretty near dead ahead, when
I come to a patch of moonlight I had to cross. I
pulled out considerable to ride around a spur just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
beyond, so when that shot came I was facin&#8217; pretty near
due east. The bullet hit me in the left leg, yuh recollect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton&#8217;s eyes narrowed. &#8220;Then it must have been
fired from the north&mdash;from the direction of the&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly as Rick&#8217;s fingers gripped
his wrist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; breathed Bemis, in a voice that was scarcely
audible.</p>
<p>He was staring over the low foot-board of the bed
straight at the open door, and Buck swiftly followed
the direction of his glance. For an instant he saw
nothing. The doorway was quite empty, and he
could not hear a sound. Then, of a sudden, his gaze
swept on across the living-room and he caught his
breath.</p>
<p>On the further wall, directly opposite the bedroom
door, hung a long mirror in a tarnished gilded frame.
It reflected not only the other side of the doorway
but a portion of the wall on either side of it&mdash;reflected
clearly, among other things, the stooping figure of a
woman, her limp calico skirts dragged cautiously back
in one skinny hand, her sharp, swarthy face bent
slightly forward in an unmistakable attitude of listening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>REVELATIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the Mexican woman, Maria. As Buck
recognized her he rose quietly and moved swiftly
toward the door. But if he had hoped to catch her
unawares, he was disappointed. He had scarcely
taken a step when, through the telltale mirror, he saw
her straighten like a flash and move back with catlike
swiftness toward the passage leading to the kitchen.
When he reached the living-room she stood there calm
and casual, with quite the air of one entering for the
first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mees T&#8217;orne, she ask me see if Reek, he wan&#8217;
somet&#8217;ing,&#8221; she explained, with a flash of her white
teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Buck shortly, eyeing the
woman intently. &#8220;If he does, he&#8217;ll ring the bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ver&#8217; good,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;I leave the door open
to &#8217;ear.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a nod and another smile she departed, and
Buck heard her moving away along the passage. For
a moment he was tempted to close and lock the door.
Then he realized that even if she dared return to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
eavesdropping, he would have ample warning by keeping
an eye on the mirror, and so returned to Bemis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate that woman,&#8221; said Rick, when informed of
her departure. &#8220;She&#8217;s always snoopin&#8217; around, an&#8217;
so is her greaser husband. Down at the bunk-house
it&#8217;s the same way, with Slim, an&#8217; Flint Kreeger an&#8217;
the rest. I tell yuh, I&#8217;m dead sick of being spied on,
an&#8217; plotted against, an&#8217; never knowin&#8217; when yuh may
get a knife in the back, or stop a bullet. I hate to
leave Bud, but he&#8217;s so plumb set on&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s it all about?&#8221; put in Buck impatiently.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you tell a fellow, or don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bemis flushed slightly at his tone. &#8220;I can tell yuh
this much,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;Tex don&#8217;t want them rustlers
caught. He throws a clever bluff, an&#8217; he&#8217;s pulled
the wool over Miss Mary&#8217;s eyes, but for all that, he&#8217;s
workin&#8217; on their side. What kind of a foreman is it
who&#8217;ll lose over a thousand head without stoppin&#8217; the
stealin&#8217;? It ain&#8217;t lack of brains, neither; Tex has
got them a-plenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Miss Thorne&mdash;&#8221; protested Stratton, half-incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell yuh, he&#8217;s got her buffaloed. She won&#8217;t believe
a word against him. He was here in her dad&#8217;s
time, an&#8217; he&#8217;s played his cards mighty slick since then.
She&#8217;s told yuh he can&#8217;t get men, mebbe? All rot,
of course. He could get plenty of hands, but he
don&#8217;t want &#8217;em. What&#8217;s more, he&#8217;s done his best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
to get rid of me an&#8217; Bud, an&#8217; would of long ago, only
Miss Mary won&#8217;t let him fire us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what in thunder&#8217;s his object?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8217;s to have the place to himself, I reckon. He
an&#8217; those greasers in the kitchen, and the rest of the
bunch, are as thick as thieves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean he&#8217;d find it easier to get away with
cattle if there wasn&#8217;t anybody around to keep tabs
on him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bemis hesitated. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; he replied
slowly. &#8220;Partly that, mebbe, but there&#8217;s somethin&#8217;
else. I&#8217;ve overheard things now an&#8217; then I couldn&#8217;t
make head or tail of, but they&#8217;re up to somethin&#8217;&mdash;Yuh
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;, are yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck had risen. &#8220;Got to,&#8221; he shrugged. &#8220;Miss
Thorne&#8217;s waiting for me to go down to the south pasture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bemis raised up on his pillows. &#8220;Well, listen; keep
what I said under yore hat, will yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; nodded Stratton reassuringly. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
worry about that. Anything else you want before I
go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Jest reach me my six-gun outer the holster
there in the chair. If I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be left alone with
that greaser, Pedro, I&#8217;d feel more comfortable, someway,
with that under my pillow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck did as he requested and then departed. Something
else! That was the very feeling which had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
assailed him vaguely at times, that some deviltry
which he couldn&#8217;t understand was going on beneath
the surface. As he made for the corral, a sudden
possibility flashed into his mind. With her title so
precarious, might not Mary Thorne be at the bottom
of a systematic attempt to loot the Shoe-Bar of its
movable value against the time of discovery? But
when he met her face to face the idea vanished and
he even felt ashamed of having considered it for a
moment. Whatever crookedness was going on, this
sweet-faced, clear-eyed girl was much more likely to
be a victim than one of the perpetrators. The feeling
was vastly strengthened when he had saddled up and
they rode off together.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to&mdash;to tell
you,&#8221; the girl said suddenly, breaking a brief silence.</p>
<p>Buck glanced at her to find her eyes fixed on the
ears of her horse and a faint flush staining her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;That room&mdash;&#8221; she went on determinedly, but with
an evident effort. &#8220;A man&#8217;s room&mdash; You must have
thought it strange. Indeed, I saw you thought it
strange&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she paused, and in his turn Buck felt a sudden
rush of embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to&mdash;&#8221; he began awkwardly. &#8220;It
just seemed funny to find a regular man&#8217;s room
in a household of women. I suppose it was your&mdash;your
father&#8217;s,&#8221; he added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; she returned briefly. She glanced
at him for an instant and then looked away again.
&#8220;You probably don&#8217;t know the history of the Shoe-Bar,&#8221;
she went on more firmly. &#8220;Two years ago it
was bought by a young man named Stratton. I never
met him, but he was a business acquaintance of my
father&#8217;s and naturally I heard a good deal of him from
time to time. He was a ranchman all his life and
very keen about it, and the moment he saw the Shoe-Bar
he fell in love with it. But the war came, and he
had scarcely taken title to the place before he went
off and enlisted. Just before he sailed for France he
sold the ranch to my father, with the understanding
that if he came back safely, Dad would turn it over
to him again. He felt, I suppose, how uncertain
it all was and that money in the bank would be easier
for his&mdash;his heirs, than property.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused for an instant, her lips pressed tightly
together. &#8220;He never came back,&#8221; she went on in a
lower, slightly unsteady voice. &#8220;He&mdash;gave up his life
for those of us who stayed behind. After a little
we left Chicago and came here. I loved the place at
once, and I&#8217;ve gone on caring for it increasingly ever
since. But back of everything there&#8217;s always been
a sense of the tragedy, the injustice of it all. They
never even found his body. He was just&mdash;missing.
And yet, when I came into that room, with his things
about just as he had left them when he went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
away, he seemed so <i>real</i>,&mdash;I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t touch it.
Somehow, it was all that was left of him. And even
though I&#8217;d never seen him, I felt as if I wanted to
keep it that way always in memory of a&mdash;a brave
soldier, and a&mdash;man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her low voice ceased. With face averted, she
stared in silence across the brown, scorched prairie.
Stratton, his eyes fixed straight ahead, and his cheeks
tinged with unwonted color, found it quite impossible
to speak, and for a space the stillness was broken only
by the creak of saddle-leather and the dull thud of
horses&#8217; hoofs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty fine of you to feel like that,&#8221; he said
at length. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if I gave you the idea I&mdash;I
was&mdash;curious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you would be, naturally. You see, the other
boys all know.&#8221; She turned her head and looked at
him. &#8220;I think we&#8217;re all curious at times about things
which really don&#8217;t concern us. I&#8217;ve even wondered
once or twice about you. You know you don&#8217;t talk
like the regulation cow-puncher&mdash;quite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton laughed. &#8220;Oh, but I am,&#8221; he assured her.
&#8220;I suppose the war rubbed off some of the accents,
and of course I had a pretty good education to start
with. But I&#8217;m too keen about the country and the life
to ever want to do anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face glowed. &#8220;It is wonderful,&#8221; she agreed.
&#8220;When I think of the years I&#8217;ve wasted in cities! I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
couldn&#8217;t ever go back. Even with all the worries,
this is a thousand times better. Ah! There they
are ahead. They&#8217;re turning the herd into this pasture,
you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half a mile or more to the southward a spreading
dust-cloud hugged the earth, through which, indistinctly,
Stratton could make out the moving figures
of men and cattle. The two spurred forward, reaching
the wide opening in the fence ahead of the vanguard
of steers. Passing through, they circled to
the right to avoid turning back any of the cattle, and
joined the sweating, hard-worked cow-punchers.</p>
<p>As they rode up together, Buck found Lynch&#8217;s eyes
fixed on him with an expression of angry surprise,
which was suppressed with evident difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d yuh get back so quick?&#8221; he inquired curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing more to keep me,&#8221; shrugged Stratton. &#8220;I
waited for the doctor to look Rick over, and then
thought I&#8217;d come out and see if you needed me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! Well, since you&#8217;re here, yuh might as well
whirl in. Get over on the far side of the herd an&#8217;
help Flint. Don&#8217;t let any of &#8217;em break away, but
don&#8217;t crowd &#8217;em too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Buck rode off he heard Miss Thorne ask if there
wasn&#8217;t something she could do. Lynch&#8217;s reply was
indistinct, but the tone of his voice, deferential, yet
with a faint undercurrent of honey-sweetness, irritated
him inexplicably. With a scowl, he spurred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
forward, exchanged a brief greeting with Bud Jessup
as he passed, and finally joined Kreeger, who was
having considerable difficulty in keeping the herd
together at that point.</p>
<p>During the succeeding two hours or so, Buck forgot
his irritation in the interest and excitement of the
work. Strenuous as it was, he found a distinct
pleasure in the discovery that two years&#8217; absence from
the range had not lessened his ability to hold his own.
His horse was well trained, and he thoroughly enjoyed
the frequent sharp dashes after some refractory
steer, who stubbornly opposed being driven. Before
the last animal had passed through the fence-gap
into the further pasture, he was drenched from head
to foot with perspiration and his muscles ached from
the unaccustomed labor, but all that was discounted
by the satisfaction of doing his chosen work again,
and doing it well.</p>
<p>Then, in the lull which followed, his thoughts returned
to Miss Thorne and he wondered whether there
would be any chance for further conversation with
her on the way back to the ranch-house? The question
was quickly answered in a manner he did not in the
least enjoy. After giving instructions about nailing
up the fence, Tex Lynch joined the girl, who sat her
horse at a little distance, and the two rode off together.</p>
<p>For a moment or two Stratton&#8217;s frowning glance
followed them. Then of a sudden he realized that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Slim McCabe&#8217;s shrewd eyes were fixed curiously on
him, and the discovery brought him abruptly to his
senses. For a space he had forgotten what his position
was at the Shoe-Bar. He must keep a better
guard over himself, or he would certainly arouse suspicion.
Averting his eyes, but still continuing to frown
a little as if lack of tobacco was responsible for his
annoyance, he searched through his pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got the makin&#8217;s?&#8221; he asked McCabe. &#8220;Darned if
I haven&#8217;t left mine in the bunk-house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slim readily produced a sack, and when Buck had
rolled a cigarette, he returned it with a jesting remark,
and swung himself rather stiffly out of his saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t any hammer, but I can help tighten wires,&#8221;
he commented.</p>
<p>He had intended joining Bud Jessup and trying
while helping him to get a chance to discuss some
of the things he had learned from Bemis. But somehow
he found himself working beside McCabe, and
when the fence had been put up again and they started
home, it was Slim who rode beside him, chatting
volubly and amusingly, but sticking like a leach.</p>
<p>It &#8220;gave one to think,&#8221; Stratton decided grimly,
remembering the expressive French phrase he had
heard so often overseas. He could not quite make
up his mind whether the action was deliberate or the
result of accident, but after supper he had no doubt
whatever.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>During the meal Lynch showed himself in quite
a new light. He chatted and joked with a careless
good humor which was a revelation to Stratton, whom
he treated with special favor. Afterward he asked
Buck if he didn&#8217;t want to look his patient over, and
accompanied him into Bemis&#8217;s room, remaining while
the wound was inspected and freshly dressed. Later,
in the bunk-house, he announced that they would start
a round-up next morning to pick out some three-year-olds
for shipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a rush order for twelve hundred head,&#8221; he
explained. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all have to get busy early except
Bud, who&#8217;ll stay here to look after things. If any
of yuh have saddles or anythin&#8217; else to look after,
yuh&#8217;d better do it to-night, so&#8217;s we can get goin&#8217; by
daybreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like a flash Stratton realized the other&#8217;s game,
and his eyes narrowed ever so little. So that was
it! By this most simple of expedients, he was to be
kept away from the ranch-house and incidentally from
any communication with Bemis or Bud, or Mary
Thorne, unless accompanied by Lynch or one of his
satellites. And the worst of it was he was quite helpless.
He was merely a common, ordinary hand,
and at the first sign of disobedience, or even evasion
of orders, Lynch would have a perfectly good excuse
to discharge him&mdash;an excuse he was doubtless itching
to create.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>BUCK FINDS OUT SOMETHING</h3>
</div>

<p>When the fact is chronicled that no less than
three times in the succeeding eight days Buck
Stratton was strongly tempted to put an end to the
whole puzzling business by the simple expedient of
declaring his identity and taking possession of the
Shoe-Bar as his own, something may be guessed of
the ingenuity of Tex Lynch in making life unpleasant
for the new hand.</p>
<p>Buck told himself more than once that if he had
really been a new hand and nothing more, he wouldn&#8217;t
have lasted forty-eight hours. Any self-respecting
cow-man would have promptly demanded his time and
betaken himself to another outfit, and Stratton sometimes
wondered whether his mere acceptance of the
persecution might not rouse the foreman&#8217;s suspicion
that he had motives for staying which did not appear
on the surface.</p>
<p>He had to admit that Lynch&#8217;s whole course of
action was rather cleverly worked out. It consisted
mainly in giving Stratton the most difficult and
arduous work to do, and keeping him at it longer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
than anyone else, not only on the round-up, but while
driving the herd to Paloma Springs and right up to
the point where the steers were loaded on cattle-cars
and the job was over.</p>
<p>That, broadly speaking, was the scheme; but there
were delicate touches of refinement and ingenuity in
the process which wrung from Stratton, in rare intervals
when he was not too furious to judge calmly,
a grudging measure of admiration for the wily foreman.
Frequently, for instance, Stratton would be
assigned to night-herd duty with promise of relief at
a certain hour. Almost always that relief failed to
materialize, and Buck, unable to leave the herd, reeling
with fatigue and cursing impotently, had to keep
at it till daybreak. The erring puncher generally had
an excellent excuse, which might have passed muster
once, but which grew threadbare with repetition.</p>
<p>Then, after an hour or two of sleep, the victim
was more likely than not to be dragged out of bed
and ordered to take the place of Peters, Kreeger, or
one of the others, who had been sent to the ranch or
elsewhere on so-called necessary business. More than
once the others got started on a meal ahead of him,
and what food remained was cold, unappetizing, and
scant in quantity. There were other little things
Lynch thought of from time to time to make Buck&#8217;s
life miserable, and he quite succeeded, though it must
be said that Stratton&#8217;s hard-won self-control
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
prevented the foreman from enjoying the full measure
of his triumph.</p>
<p>What chiefly influenced Buck in holding back his
big card and scoring against them all was the feeling
that Mary Thorne would be the one to suffer most.
He would be putting an abrupt finish to Lynch&#8217;s game,
whatever that was, but his action would also involve
the girl in deep and bitter humiliation, if not something
worse. Moreover, he was not quite ready to stop
Lynch&#8217;s scheming. He wanted to find out first what
it was all about, and he felt he had a better chance
of success by continuing to play his present part,
hedged in and handicapped though he was, than by
coming out suddenly in his own proper person.</p>
<p>So he stuck it out to the end, successfully suppressing
all evidence of the smouldering rage that grew
steadily within him against the whole crowd. Returning
to the ranch for the first time in more than a
week, he went to bed directly after supper and slept like
a log until breakfast. Rising, refreshed and fit, he
decided that the time had come to abandon his former
haphazard methods of getting information, and to
launch a campaign of active detective work without
further delay.</p>
<p>Since the night of Bemis&#8217;s accident, Buck had
scarcely had a word with Bud Jessup, who he felt could
give him some information, though he was not counting
much on the importance of what the youngster
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
was likely to know. Through the day there was no
chance of getting the fellow apart. But Buck kept
his eyes and ears open, and at supper-time Bud&#8217;s casual
remark to Lynch that he &#8220;s&#8217;posed he&#8217;d have to fix
that busted saddle-girth before he hit the hay&#8221; did
not escape him.</p>
<p>The meal over, Stratton left the kitchen and headed
for the bunk-house with a purposeful air, soon leaving
the others well in the rear. Presently one of them
snickered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like the poor rube&#8217;s goin&#8217; to tear off some
more sleep,&#8221; commented Kreeger in a suppressed tone,
evidently not thinking Stratton was near enough to
hear.</p>
<p>But Buck&#8217;s ears were sharp, and his lips twitched
in a grim smile as he moved steadily on, shoulders
purposely sagging. When he had passed through the
doorway his head went up abruptly and his whole
manner changed. Darting to his bunk, he snatched
the blankets out and unrolled them with a jerk.
Scrambling his clothes and other belongings into a
rough mound, he swiftly spread the blankets over
them, patted down a place or two to increase the
likeness to a human body, dropped his hat on the
floor beside the bunk, and then made a lightning exit
through a window at the rear.</p>
<p>It was all accomplished with such celerity that before
the dawdling punchers had entered the bunk-house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Buck was out of sight among the bushes which
thickly lined the creek. From here he had no difficulty
in making his way unseen around to the back of
the barns and other out-buildings, one of which he entered
through a rear door. A moment or two later he
found Jessup, as he expected, squatting on the floor
of the harness-room, busily mending his broken saddle-girth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Bud,&#8221; he grinned, as the youngster looked
up in surprise. &#8220;Thought I&#8217;d come up and have
a chin with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how the deuce&mdash;I thought they&mdash;yuh&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought right,&#8221; replied Stratton, as Jessup
hesitated. &#8220;Tex and his friends have been sticking
around pretty close for the past week or so, but I
gave &#8217;em the slip just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Briefly he explained what he had done, and then
paused, eying the young fellow speculatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something queer going on here, old man,&#8221;
he began presently. &#8220;You&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s none of my
business, maybe, and I reckon it isn&#8217;t. But unless
I&#8217;ve sized &#8217;em up wrong, Lynch and his gang are a
bunch of crooks, and I&#8217;m not the sort to sit back
quietly and leave a lady like Miss Thorne to their
mercy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessup&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;What do yuh know?&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;What have yuh found out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Found out? Why,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
nothing, really. But I&#8217;ve seen enough to know that
bunch is up to some deviltry, and naturally the owner
of the outfit is the one who&#8217;ll suffer, in pocket, if
not something worse. It&#8217;s a dirty deal, taking advantage
of a girl&#8217;s ignorance and inexperience, as
that gang sure is doing some way&mdash;specially a girl
who&#8217;s as decent and white as she is. I thought maybe
you and me might get together and work out something.
You don&#8217;t act like you were for &#8217;em any more
than I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell a man I ain&#8217;t!&#8221; declared Jessup emphatically.
&#8220;They&#8217;re a rotten bunch. Yuh can go
as far&#8217;s you like, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll stick with yuh. Have yuh
got anything on &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly, but we may have if we put our heads
together and talk it over.&#8221; He glanced questioningly
around the dusty room. &#8220;They&#8217;ll likely find out
the trick I played on &#8217;em, and come snooping around
here before long. Suppose we slip out and go down
by the creek where we can talk without being interrupted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessup agreed readily and followed Buck into the
barn and out through the back door, where they sought
a secluded spot down by the stream, well shielded by
bushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been here longer than I have and noticed
a lot more,&#8221; Stratton remarked when they were
settled. &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d tell me what you think that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
bunch is up to. They haven&#8217;t let me out of their
sight for over a week. What&#8217;s the idea, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t want yuh should find out anythin&#8217;,&#8221;
returned Bud promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I s&#8217;posed, but what&#8217;s there to find
out? That&#8217;s what I can&#8217;t seem to get at. Bemis
says they&#8217;re in with the rustlers, but even he seems
to think there&#8217;s something else in the wind besides
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessup snorted contemptuously. &#8220;Bemis&mdash;huh! I&#8217;m
through with him. He&#8217;s a quitter. I was in
chinnin&#8217; with him last night an&#8217; he&#8217;s lost his nerve.
Says he&#8217;s through, an&#8217; is goin&#8217; to take his time the
minute he&#8217;s fit to back a horse. Still an&#8217; all,&#8221; he
added, forehead wrinkling thoughtfully, &#8220;he&#8217;s right
in a way. There is somethin&#8217; doin&#8217; beside rustling,
but I&#8217;m hanged if I can find out what. The only
thing I&#8217;m dead sure of is that it&#8217;s crooked. Look
at the way they&#8217;re tryin&#8217; to get rid of us&mdash;Rick an&#8217; me
an&#8217; you. Whatever they&#8217;re up to they want the
ranch to themselves before they go any further. Now
Rick&#8217;s out of the way, I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll be next. They&#8217;re
tryin&#8217; their best to make me quit, but when they find
out that won&#8217;t work, I reckon they&#8217;ll try somethin&#8217;&mdash;worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t Lynch just up an&#8217; fire you?&#8221; Buck asked
curiously. &#8220;He&#8217;s foreman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud&#8217;s young jaw tightened stubbornly. &#8220;He can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
get nothin&#8217; on me,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;It&#8217;s this way. When
help begun to get shy a couple of months ago&mdash;that&#8217;s
when he started his business of gittin&#8217; rid of the men
one way or another&mdash;Tex must of hinted around to
Miss Mary that I was goin&#8217; to quit, for she up an&#8217;
asked me one day if it was true, an&#8217; said she hoped me
an&#8217; Rick wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; to leave like the rest of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, a faint flush darkening his tan. &#8220;I
dunno as you&#8217;ve noticed it,&#8221; he went on, plucking a
long spear of grass and twisting it between his brown
fingers, &#8220;but Miss Mary&#8217;s got a way about her that&mdash;that
sort of gets a man. She&#8217;s so awful young, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;earnest,
an&#8217; though she don&#8217;t know one thing
hardly about ranchin&#8217;, she&#8217;s dead crazy about this
place, an&#8217; mighty anxious to make it pay. When she
asks yuh to do somethin&#8217;, yuh jest natu&#8217;ally feel like
yuh wanted to oblige. I felt like that, anyhow, an&#8217; I
was hot under the collar at Tex for lyin&#8217; about me
like he must of done. So I tells her straight off I
wasn&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; of anythin&#8217; of the sort. &#8216;Fu&#8217;thermore,&#8217;
I says, &#8216;I&#8217;ll stick to the job as long as yuh like
if you&#8217;ll do one thing.&#8217; She asks what&#8217;s that, an&#8217;
I told her that some folks, namin&#8217; no names, was tryin&#8217;
to make out to her I wasn&#8217;t doin&#8217; my work good, an&#8217;
doin&#8217; their best to get me in bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, but I think you&#8217;re mistaken,&#8217; she says,
catchin&#8217; on right away who I meant. &#8216;Tex wouldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
do anythin&#8217; like that. He needs help too bad, for one
thing.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; I says, &#8216;let it go at that. Only, if yuh hear
anythin&#8217; against me, I&#8217;d like for yuh not to take anybody
else&#8217;s word for it. It&#8217;s got to be proved I ain&#8217;t
capable, or I&#8217;ve done somethin&#8217; I oughta be fired for.
An&#8217; if things gets so I got to go, I&#8217;ll come to yuh an&#8217;
ask for my time myself. Fu&#8217;thermore, I&#8217;ll get Rick
to promise the same thing.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to make a long story short, she said she&#8217;d do
it, though I could see she was still thinkin&#8217; me mistaken
about Tex doin&#8217; anythin&#8217; out of the way. He&#8217;s
a rotten skunk, but you&#8217;d better believe he don&#8217;t let
her see it. He&#8217;s got her so she believes every darn
word he says is gospel.&#8221;</p>
<p>He finished in an angry key. Stratton&#8217;s face was
thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long has he been here?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Tex? Oh, long before I come. The old
man made him foreman pretty near a year ago in
place of Bloss, who run the outfit for Stratton, that
fellow who was killed in the war that old Thorne
bought the ranch off from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of a man was this Thorne?&#8221; Buck
presently inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty decent, though kinda stand-offish with us
fellows. He was awful thick with Tex, though, an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
mebbe that&#8217;s the reason Miss Mary thinks so much of
him. She took his death mighty hard, believe me!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a mind groping after hidden clues, Stratton
subconsciously disentangled the various &#8220;hes&#8221; and
&#8220;hims&#8221; of Jessup&#8217;s slightly involved remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pop Daggett told me about his being thrown and
breaking his neck,&#8221; he said presently. &#8220;You were
here then, weren&#8217;t you? Was there anything queer
about it? I mean, like the two punchers who were
killed later on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessup&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;Queer?&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;Why, I&mdash;I never thought about it that way. I wasn&#8217;t
around when it happened. Nobody was with him but&mdash;but&mdash;Tex.&#8221;
He stared at Buck. &#8220;Yuh don&#8217;t mean
to say&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say anything,&#8221; returned Stratton, as he
paused. &#8220;How can I, without knowing the facts?
Was the horse a bad one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was new&mdash;jest been put in the <i>remuda</i>. I
never saw him rid except by Doc Peters, who&#8217;s a
shark. I did notice, afterward, he was sorta mean,
though I&#8217;ve seen worse. We was on the spring
round-up, jest startin&#8217; to brand over in the middle
pasture.&#8221; Bud spoke slowly with thoughtfully
wrinkled brows. &#8220;It was right after dinner when the
old man rode up on Socks, the horse he gen&#8217;ally used.
He seemed pretty excited for him. He got hold of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Tex right away, an&#8217; the two of them went off to one
side an&#8217; chinned consid&#8217;able. Then they changed the
saddle onto this here paint horse, Socks bein&#8217; sorta
tuckered out, an&#8217; rode off together. It was near three
hours before Tex came gallopin&#8217; back alone with word
that the old man&#8217;s horse had stepped in a hole an&#8217;
throwed him, breakin&#8217; his neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that part of it true?&#8221; asked Buck, who had
been listening intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;About his neck? Sure. They had Doc Blanchard
over right away. He&#8217;d been throwed, all right,
too, from the scratches on his face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh got me. I wasn&#8217;t one of the bunch that
brought him in. I never thought to ask afterwards,
neither. It must of been somewhere up to the north
end of the ranch, though, if they kep&#8217; on goin&#8217; the
way they started.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment or two Stratton sat silent, staring
absently at the sloping bank below him. Was there
anything back of the ranch-owner&#8217;s tragic death save
simple accident? The story was plausible enough.
Holes were plentiful, and it wouldn&#8217;t be the first time
a horse&#8217;s stumble had resulted fatally to the rider. On
the other hand, it is quite possible, by an abrupt though
seemingly accidental thrust or collision, to stir a horse
of uncertain temper into sudden, vehement action.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
At length Buck sighed and abandoned his cogitations
as fruitless. Short of a miracle, that phase of the
problem was never likely to be answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what took him off like that?&#8221; he pondered
aloud. &#8220;Have you any notion? Is there anything
particular up that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no. Nobody hardly ever goes there. They
call it the north pasture, but it&#8217;s never used. There&#8217;s
nothin&#8217; there but sand an&#8217; cactus an&#8217; all that; a goat
couldn&#8217;t hardly keep body an&#8217; soul together. Except
once lookin&#8217; for strays that got through the fence,
I never set foot in it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down in the shallow gully where they sat, the
shadows were gathering, showing that dusk was rapidly
approaching. With a shake of his head and a
movement of his wide shoulders, Buck mentally dismissed
that subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting dark,&#8221; he said briskly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have
to hustle, or there&#8217;ll be a searching party out after
us. Have you noticed anything else particularly&mdash;about
Lynch, I mean, or any of the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; I can make sense of,&#8221; returned Jessup.
&#8220;Tex has been off the ranch a lot. Two or three
times he&#8217;s stayed away over night. It might of been
reg&#8217;lar business, I s&#8217;pose, but once Bill Harris, over
to the Rockin&#8217;-R, said he&#8217;d seen him in Tucson with
some guys in a big automobile. That rustlin&#8217;, of
course, yuh know about. On the evidence, I dunno
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
as yuh could swear he was in it, but it&#8217;s a sure thing
that any foreman worth his salt would of stopped the
business before now, or else get the sheriff on the job
if he couldn&#8217;t handle it himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve wondered,&#8221; commented
Buck. &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he? What&#8217;s his excuse for
holding off?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud gave a short, brittle laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell yuh. He
says the sheriff&#8217;s a crook! What do you know about
that? I heard him tellin&#8217; it to Miss Mary the other
day when he come in from Paloma about dinner-time.
She was askin&#8217; him the same question, an&#8217; he up an&#8217;
tells her it wouldn&#8217;t be worth while; tells her the
man is a half-breed an&#8217; always plays in with the
greasers, so he wouldn&#8217;t be no use. I never met
up with Jim Hardenberg, but he sure ain&#8217;t a breed,
an&#8217; he&#8217;s got a darn good rep as sheriff.&#8221; He groaned.
&#8220;Wimmin sure is queer. Think of anybody believin&#8217;
that sort of rot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Lynch know you were listening?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessup reddened a little. &#8220;No. They were talkin&#8217;
in the big room, an&#8217; I was standin&#8217; to one side of the
open window. I don&#8217;t call it sneakin&#8217; to try an&#8217; get
the drop on a coyote like him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t either,&#8221; smiled Stratton, getting on his
feet. The swift, southern darkness had fallen so
quickly that they could barely see each other&#8217;s faces.
&#8220;It&#8217;s one of their own little tricks, and turn about is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
fair play. Our job, I reckon, is to keep our eyes open
every minute and not let anything slip. We&#8217;ll find
a way to get together again if anything should turn
up. I&#8217;ll be going back.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away and took a few steps along the
bank. Then all at once he stopped and walked back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Bud, how big is that north pasture place you
were telling about?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to remember
going over it when I was&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly, and a sudden flush burned
into his cheeks at the realization that he had almost
betrayed himself. Fortunately Jessup did not seem
to notice the slip.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly,&#8221; replied the youngster.
&#8220;About two miles square, maybe. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I just wondered,&#8221; shrugged Stratton. &#8220;Well,
so-long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again they parted, Bud returning to the harness-room,
where he would have to finish his work by lantern-light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, but that was close!&#8221; murmured Bud, feeling
his way through the darkness. &#8220;Just about one
more word and I&#8217;d have given away the show completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused under a cottonwood as a gleam of light
from the open bunk-house door showed through the
leaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder?&#8221; he mused thoughtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>A waste of sand, cactus, and scanty desert growth!
In Arizona nothing is more ordinary or commonplace,
more utterly lacking in interest and significance.
Yet Stratton&#8217;s mind returned to it persistently as he
considered one by one the scanty details of Jessup&#8217;s
brief narrative.</p>
<p>What was there about a spot like that to rouse excitement
in the breast of the usually phlegmatic
Andrew Thorne? Why had he been in such haste to
drag Lynch thither, and what had passed between the
two before the older man came to his sudden and
tragic end? Was it possible that somewhere within
that four square miles of desolate wilderness might
lie the key to the puzzling mystery Buck had set himself
to solve?</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder?&#8221; he murmured again, and leaving the
margin of the creek, he moved slowly toward the open
bunk-house door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>DANGER</h3>
</div>

<p>As Buck appeared in the doorway, blinking a
little at the lamp-light, the five card-players
stared at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the devil have you been?&#8221; inquired Kreeger,
surprised out of his accustomed taciturnity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought yuh was asleep,&#8221; added Peters, casting
a bewildered glance at the shadowy bunk.</p>
<p>Buck, who had scarcely hoped his little stratagem
would succeed so well, refrained with difficulty from
showing the pleasure he felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have,&#8221; he drawled.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought yuh was in yore bunk,&#8221; commented
McCabe, his light-blue eyes narrowing slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I was outside,&#8221; explained Stratton carelessly.
&#8220;It was too hot in here, so I went out and sat down
by the creek. I must have dropped off pretty soon,
and when I came to it was dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke he glanced casually at Tex Lynch, and
despite himself a little shiver flickered on his spine.
The foreman, who had not spoken, sat motionless on
the further side of the table regarding Stratton steadily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
His lids drooped slightly and his face was almost
expressionless. But in spite of that Buck got a momentary
impression of baffled fury and a deadly,
murderous hate, the more startling because of its
very repression. Coupling it with what he knew or
suspected of the man, Stratton felt there was some
excuse for that momentary mental shrinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d as soon put me out of the way as shoot a
coyote,&#8221; he said to himself, as he walked over to his
bunk. &#8220;All he wants is a chance to do it without getting
caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>But with ordinary care and caution he did not see
just how Tex was going to get the chance. Buck never
went anywhere without his gun, and he flattered himself
he was as quick on the draw as the average. Besides,
he knew better now than to trust himself alone
with Lynch or any of the others on some outlying
part of the range where a fatal accident could plausibly
be laid to marauding greasers, or to some similar
agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying any one of &#8217;em couldn&#8217;t pick me
off a dozen times a day and make an easy get-away
across the border,&#8221; he thought, stretching himself out
on the husk mattress. &#8220;But Lynch don&#8217;t want to
have to make a get-away. There&#8217;s something right
here on the Shoe-Bar that interests him a whole lot
too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently Bud came in, parried with some success
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
the half-questioning comments of the men, and went
to bed. Buck lay awake a while longer, trying to
patch together into some semblance of pattern the
isolated scraps of information he had gained, but without
any measure of success.</p>
<p>There followed four surprising days of calm, during
which the Shoe-Bar, to every outward seeming,
might have been the most ordinary and humdrum
of outfits, with not a hint of anything sinister or mysterious
beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Each morning the men sallied forth to work, returned
for noon dinner, and rode off again soon afterward.
Lynch was neither grouchy nor over-jovial.
He seemed the typical ranch-boss, whose chief thought
is to get the work done, and his berating was entirely
impartial. Bud had spent most of his time around
the ranch, but once or twice he rode out with the
others, and there was no attempt on their part to keep
him and Buck from talking together as privately as
they pleased. Only where Miss Thorne was concerned
was Stratton conscious of the old unobtrusive
surveillance. He saw her several times during
his brief visits to Bemis, who was improving daily
and fretting to be gone, but always Lynch, McCabe,
or some one just &#8220;happened&#8221; to be along.</p>
<p>The effect of this unexpected peace and quiet on
Stratton, however, was precisely opposite from the one
he presumed was intended. He had a feeling that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
was a calm before the storm, and became more alert
than ever. The unnatural placidity weighed on him,
and as day followed day serenely his nerves grew edgy.</p>
<p>After supper on the fourth day Lynch went up to
the ranch-house and was closeted for more than an
hour with Miss Thorne. On his return to the bunk-house,
Stratton, who had now come to speculate on
his every move, studied him covertly but found his
manner quite as usual.</p>
<p>In the morning they started off for the middle pasture,
where they were engaged in repairing a fence
which had all but fallen flat. Quite by accident, and
without any inkling of what was to come of his carelessness,
Buck left his hammer and pliers beside the
corral gate instead of sticking them into his saddle-pockets.
Before they had gone a quarter of a mile
he discovered the omission and pulled up, explaining
what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t take me five minutes to go back for
them,&#8221; he added, gathering up his reins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with yuh,&#8221; said McCabe promptly. &#8220;With
a little hustlin&#8217;, we can easy catch up with the gang
before they get to the pasture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, speed up, both of yuh,&#8221; admonished Lynch.
&#8220;We want to finish that job to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slightly amused and wondering whether they
thought for an instant he was too blind to see through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
their game, Stratton put spurs to his horse and the two
rode back together, McCabe apparently making a special
effort to be amusing. The tools were found where
Buck had left them, and the latter was on the point of
remounting, when Mary Thorne came suddenly around
the corner of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; she greeted them both pleasantly,
but with a slight undercurrent of preoccupation in her
manner. &#8220;I was afraid you&#8217;d gone.&#8221; Her eyes met
Stratton&#8217;s. &#8220;Could I speak to you a moment?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck dropped his bridle-reins and moved forward.
For an instant McCabe sat motionless; then he swung
himself out of the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s anythin&#8217; I can help about&mdash;&#8221; he began,
awkwardly, yet ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Slim, but it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; the
girl answered quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t got much time,&#8221; protested McCabe uneasily.
&#8220;We jest came back to get them tools Buck
forgot. Tex is in a hurry to finish up the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe five minutes&#8217; delay will matter very
much,&#8221; returned Miss Thorne, with a touch of that
unexpected decision Stratton had noticed once or twice
before. &#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved away from the corral and Buck, walking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
beside her, was conscious of a curious tension in the
air. For a moment he thought McCabe meant to persist
and force his presence on them. But evidently
the stocky cow-puncher found the situation too difficult
for him to cope with, for he remained standing beside
his horse, though his glance followed them intently,
and throughout the brief interview his eyes searched
their faces, as if he strove to read from their expression
or the movement of their lips some inkling of
what it was all about.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t keep you but a moment,&#8221; the girl began,
her color slightly heightened. &#8220;I only thought that
perhaps I might persuade you to&mdash;to change your
mind, and&mdash;and stay. If the work&#8217;s too hard, we
might be able to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused. Buck stared at her in astonishment.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he said briefly.</p>
<p>Her flush deepened. &#8220;I meant about your going.
I understood you weren&#8217;t satisfied, and wanted to&mdash;to
leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;Tex. Isn&#8217;t it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck frowned, and then, conscious of the watching
McCabe, his face cleared and he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have got me wrong, Miss Ma&mdash;er&mdash;Thorne,&#8221;
he returned lightly. &#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;s heard
me grumbling a bit; cow-men do that from force of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
habit sometimes, you know. But I&#8217;ve nothing to
complain of about the work, and certainly I had no
idea of quitting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face cleared amazingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; she
said in a relieved tone. &#8220;I suppose I seem fussy, but
now and then the problem of help gets to be a regular
nightmare. Once or twice lately I&#8217;ve been afraid I
was making a terrible mess of things, and might, after
all, have to accept one of the offers I&#8217;ve had for the
ranch. I should hate dreadfully to leave here, but if
I can&#8217;t make it pay&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She finished with a shrug. Stratton regarded her
thoughtfully. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had several offers?&#8221; he asked
hesitatingly, wondering whether she would think the
question an impertinence.</p>
<p>Apparently she didn&#8217;t. &#8220;Two; really most awfully
good ones. Indeed, Tex strongly advised me to sell out
and buy another outfit if I still wanted to ranch. But
I don&#8217;t want another one. It&#8217;s the Shoe-Bar I&#8217;m so
keen about because of&mdash; But I really mustn&#8217;t keep you.
Thank you so much for relieving my mind. When
Tex comes in I&#8217;ll tell him he was mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck hesitated for an instant. &#8220;It might be better
not to say anything about it,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Some
foremen don&#8217;t like the least bit of interference, you
know. Suppose we just let it go, and if he brings up
the subject to me, I&#8217;ll tell him he got me wrong.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. It doesn&#8217;t make any difference so long
as you&#8217;re staying. Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a little gesture of farewell, she walked away
toward the ranch-house, leaving Stratton to return to
where McCabe fidgeted beside the horses. There was
no time for deliberate reasoning or planning. Buck
only felt sure that Lynch was up to something underhand,
and when Slim, with almost too great a casualness,
inquired what it was all about, he obeyed a strong
impulse and lied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Bemis,&#8221; he shrugged, as they rode off
together. &#8220;He&#8217;s fretting to get away. Lost his
nerve, I reckon, and wants to pull out. She wanted to
know how long I thought it would be before he could
back a horse. I s&#8217;pose he might chance it in about a
week, but I&#8217;m hanged if I can see why he&#8217;s in such
a rush. He&#8217;s sure got it soft enough here.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he talked he was busy rolling a cigarette,
but this did not prevent him from being aware of
Slim&#8217;s intent, sidelong scrutiny. He could not be
quite certain whether or not he succeeded in deceiving
the fellow, but from the character of McCabe&#8217;s
comments, he rather thought he had. Certainly he
hoped so. Slim was sure to tell Lynch about the
incident, but if he himself believed it harmless, the
foreman was likely to take the same point of view,
and continue to carry out the scheme he had in mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
Whatever this was, Stratton, in his present frame of
mind, preferred that it should be brought to a head
rather than continue any longer in suspense.</p>
<p>Throughout the day he could get no hint of what
was going on. Once the thought occurred to him
that it might be a variation of the trick Lynch had
tried to play on Bud. By preparing Miss Thorne
beforehand for the departure of the new hand, he
could discharge Stratton and then represent to the
girl that he had quit of his own accord. But somehow
this didn&#8217;t altogether fit. It assumed that Buck
would take his dismissal quietly without attempting a
personal appeal to the ranch-owner; also it took no
account of Bud Jessup. By this time Tex must
realize that there had been more or less intimate communication
between the two, and Bud was not the sort
to stand by quietly and see his friend turned out without
stirring vehemently in his behalf.</p>
<p>Considering all this, Buck could not see that there
was much to fear in Lynch&#8217;s present man&oelig;uvering;
and it was something of a shock to find Bud absent
from the supper-table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to Paloma to fetch those wagon-bolts,&#8221; explained
Tex, who had come in about an hour ahead of
the others, in answer to Peters&#8217; query. &#8220;They&#8217;d
ought to of come in by mail yesterday or the day before,
an&#8217; we need &#8217;em bad. He&#8217;ll get supper in town an&#8217;
be back before dark.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>Somewhat thoughtful, Buck accompanied the others
to the bunk-house, where he was cordially invited to
join the evening game of draw, but declined on the plea
of having a couple of letters to write. It was a subterfuge,
of course; he had nobody to write to. But
in his mind had risen a strong preference for being in
a position where he could overlook the whole group,
rather than be seated in their very midst.</p>
<p>There had come to him a sudden, vivid conviction
that he had underestimated the foreman&#8217;s resources
and his own possible danger. As he sat there mechanically
scribbling random sentences, it was brought
home to him for the first time how unpleasantly alone
he was. Save for a helpless girl and an even more
helpless old woman, there wasn&#8217;t a soul within a dozen
miles on whom he could count for help in an emergency.
Of course when Bud returned&mdash;</p>
<p>But Bud didn&#8217;t return. Nine o&#8217;clock brought no
sign of him. Another hour passed and still he failed
to show up. It began to look very much as if the
youngster had met with some accident or was being
purposely kept out of the way.</p>
<p>When the men finished their game and began to
turn in, Stratton reluctantly followed their example.
As long as there was any light he felt perfectly able to
take care of himself. It was the darkness he feared&mdash;that
inky, suffocating darkness which masks everything
like a pall. He dreaded, too, the increased chances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
bed would bring of yielding for a single fatal instant
to treacherous sleep; but he couldn&#8217;t well sit up all
night, so he undressed leisurely with the rest and
stretched his long length between the blankets.</p>
<p>When the lamp was out, he cautiously flung aside
his coverings, drew himself into a reclining position,
and with gun in one hand and some matches close beside
the other, began his vigil.</p>
<p>For a long time&mdash;it must have been an hour at
least&mdash;there was no need to fight off sleep. His mind
was far too active. But his thoughts were not altogether
cheering, for he began to see clearly how Lynch
might hope to accomplish the impossible.</p>
<p>So far there had been reassurance in the feeling
that the foreman would not dare proceed to open
violence because of the almost certain consequences to
himself. Buck realized now that, under the conditions
of the moment, those consequences might become
almost negligible. Suppose, for instance, that by next
morning Stratton had disappeared. Lynch and his
confederates would tell a plausible story of his having
demanded his time the night before and ridden off
early in the morning. It was a story Tex had carefully
prepared Miss Thorne to hear, and whether or
not, after Buck&#8217;s talk with her during the morning,
she might be suspicious, that would make no difference
in the foreman&#8217;s actions now. He would see that a
horse was gone, and attend to all the other necessary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
details. He had the better part of the night and
miles of desert waste in which to dispose of every
trace of Stratton and his belongings. Bud would be
suspicious, but between suspicion and proof there is a
great gulf fixed. And though Lynch might not know
it, one of his strongest cards was the fact that if Stratton
should vanish off the earth, there was not a soul
who would ever come around asking awkward
questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to be bumped off just now,
thank you,&#8221; Buck said to himself with a grim straightening
of the lips. &#8220;They won&#8217;t dare fire a gun, and
they don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m ready for them and waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another hour passed, a tortured, harrowing hour
in which he fought sleep desperately with all the limited
resources at his command. In spite of his determination
to keep his eyes open at any cost, his lids
drooped and lifted, drooped and lifted, drooped and
were dragged open by sheer will-power. Each time
it was more difficult. Just as the water laps inexorably
at length over the face of an exhausted swimmer,
so these waves of sleep, smothering, clutching, dulled
his senses and strove to wrap him in their soft, treacherous
embrace.</p>
<p>There came at last a complete wiping out of consciousness,
how long or short he never knew, from
which he was jarred into sudden wakefulness by a
sound. He had no idea what it was nor whence it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
came. He merely found himself abruptly in full possession
of his senses, nerves tingling, moisture dewing
his forehead, his whole being concentrated in the one
act of&mdash;listening!</p>
<p>For what seemed an eternity he could hear nothing
save the heavy breathing of sleeping men. Then it
came again, a slow, faint, dragging sound that ceased
almost as soon as it began.</p>
<p>Some one was creeping stealthily toward him across
the cabin floor!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THWARTED</h3>
</div>

<p>Instantly a sense of elation, tingling as an
electric shock, surged over Stratton, and his grip
on the Colt tightened. At last he was face to face with
something definite and concrete, and in a moment
all the little doubts and nagging nervous qualms which
had assailed him from time to time during his long
vigil were swept away. Cautiously drawing his gun
into position, he felt for a match with the other hand
and prepared to scratch it against the side of the bunk.</p>
<p>Slowly, stealthily, with many a cautious pause, the
crawling body drew steadily nearer. Though the intense
darkness prevented him from seeing anything,
Buck felt at last that he had correctly gaged the position
of the unknown plotter. Trying to continue that
easy, steady breathing, which had been no easy matter,
he slightly raised his weapon and then, with a sudden,
lightning movement, he drew the match firmly across
the rough board.</p>
<p>To his anger and chagrin the head broke off. Before
he could snatch up another and strike it viciously,
there came from close at hand a sudden rustle, a creak,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
the clatter of something on the floor, followed by
dead silence. When the light flared up, illumining
dimly almost the whole length of the room, there was
nothing in the least suspicious to be seen.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with inward cursing, Stratton sprang
up and lit the lamp he had used early in the evening
and which he had purposely left within reach. With
this added illumination he made a discovery that
brought his lips together in a grim line.</p>
<p>Someone lay stretched out in the bunk next to his
own&mdash;Jessup&#8217;s bunk, which had been empty when he
went to bed.</p>
<p>For a fleeting instant Buck wondered whether Bud
could possibly have returned and crawled in there unheard.
Then, as the wick flared up, he not only
realized that this couldn&#8217;t have happened, but recognized
lying on the youngster&#8217;s rolled-up blankets
the stout figure and round, unshaven face of&mdash;Slim
McCabe.</p>
<p>As he stood staring at the fellow, there was a stir
from further down the room and a sleepy voice
growled:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? It ain&#8217;t time to get up
yet, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck, who had just caught a glint of steel on the
floor at the edge of the bunk, pulled himself together.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&mdash;I must have had a&mdash;nightmare,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
returned in a realistically dazed tone. &#8220;I was dreaming
about&mdash;rustlers, and thought I heard somebody walking
around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still watching McCabe surreptitiously, he saw the
fellow&#8217;s lids lift sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;a&#8217;s matter?&#8221; murmured Slim, blinking at the
lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I was dreaming. What the devil are
you doing in that bunk?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCabe appeared to rouse himself with an effort
and partly sat up, yawning prodigiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was hot in my own, so I come over here to get
the air from the window,&#8221; he mumbled. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the idea of waking a guy up in the middle of the
night?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck did not answer for a moment but, stepping
back, trod as if by accident on the end of his trailing
blanket. As he intended, the movement sent his
holster and belt tumbling to the floor, and with perfect
naturalness he stooped to pick them up. When he
straightened, his face betrayed nothing of the grim
satisfaction he felt at having proved his point. The bit
of steel was a hunting-knife with a seven-inch blade,
sharp as a razor, and with a distinctive stag-horn handle,
which Tex Lynch had used only a few evenings
before to remove the skin from a coyote he had brought
down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, but I was dreaming,&#8221; drawled Stratton.
&#8220;No harm done, though, is there? You ain&#8217;t likely to
stay awake long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further comment he blew out the light and
crawled into bed again. He found no difficulty now in
keeping awake for the remainder of the night; there
was too much to think about and decide. Now that
he had measured the lengths to which Lynch seemed
willing to go, he realized that a continuance of present
conditions was impossible. An exact repetition of
this particular attempt was unlikely, but there were
plenty of variations against which no single individual
could hope to guard. He must bring things to a head
at once, either by quitting the ranch, by playing the
important card of his own identity he had so far held
back, or else by finding some other way of tying
Lynch&#8217;s hands effectually. He was equally reluctant
to take either of the two former steps, and so it pleased
him greatly when at last he began to see his way toward
working things out in another fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m blessed if that won&#8217;t put a spoke in his
wheel,&#8221; he thought jubilantly, considering details.
&#8220;He won&#8217;t dare to touch me.&#8221;</p>
<p>When dawn came filtering through the windows,
and one thing after another slowly emerged from the
obscurity, Buck&#8217;s eyes swiftly sought the floor below
Bud&#8217;s bunk. But though McCabe lay there snoring
loudly, the knife had disappeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>Though outwardly everything seemed normal, Buck
noticed a slight restlessness and laxing tension about
the men that morning. There was delay in getting to
work, which might have been accounted for by the
cessation of one job and the starting of another. But
knowing what he did, Stratton felt that the flat failure
of their plot had much to do with it.</p>
<p>He himself took advantage of the lull to slip away
to the harness-room on the plea of mending a rip in
the stitching of his chaps. Pulling a box over by the
window where he could see anyone approaching, he
produced pencil and paper and proceeded to write out
a rather voluminous document, which he afterward
read over and corrected carefully. He sealed it up in
an envelope, wrote a much briefer note, and enclosed
both in a second envelope which he addressed to
Sheriff J. Hardenberg. Finally he felt around in his
pocket and pulled forth the scrawl he had composed the
night before.</p>
<p>&#8220;They look about the same,&#8221; he murmured, comparing
them. &#8220;Nobody will notice the difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck was on the point of sealing the envelope containing
the scrawl when it occurred to him to read the
contents over and see what he had written.</p>
<p>The letter was headed &#8220;Dear Friend,&#8221; and proved
to be a curious composition. With a mind intent on
other things, Stratton had written almost mechanically,
intending merely to give an air of reality to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
occupation. In the beginning the scrawl read very much
as if the &#8220;friend&#8221; were masculine. Bits of ranch happenings
and descriptions were jotted down as one
would in writing to a cow-boy friend located on a distant
outfit. But gradually, imperceptibly almost, the
tone shifted. Buck himself had been totally unaware
of any change until he read over the last few pages.
And then, as he took in the subtle undercurrent of
meaning which lay beneath the penciled lines, a slow
flush crept up into his face, and he frowned.</p>
<p>It was all rot, of course! He had merely written
for the sake of writing something&mdash;anything. She
was a nice little thing, of course, with an attractive
feminine manner and an unexpected lot of nerve. He
was sorry for her, naturally, and would like to help
her out of what he felt to be a most disagreeable, if
not hazardous situation. But as for anything
further&mdash;</p>
<p>Still frowning, he thrust the sheets back into the
envelope and licked the flap. He was on the point
of stubbornly scrawling a man&#8217;s name on the outside
when he realized how foolish he would be not to
carry out his first and much more sensible intention.</p>
<p>He wanted an excuse for asking permission to ride
to town to post a letter. This, in itself, was an extremely
nervy request and under ordinary conditions
almost certain to be profanely refused. But Buck
had a shrewd notion that after the failure of Lynch&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
plans, the foreman might welcome the chance of talking
things over with his confederates without danger
of being observed or overheard. On the other hand,
if there should be the least suspicion that his letter
was not of the most innocent and harmless sort, he
would never in the world be allowed to get away with
it.</p>
<p>The result was that when he strolled out of the
harness-room a little later the envelope bearing the
name of Sheriff Hardenberg reposed within his shirt,
while the other, addressed now to a mythical &#8220;Miss
Florence Denby,&#8221; at an equally mythical street number
in Dallas, Texas, protruded from a pocket of his chaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ve got a stamp you&#8217;ll sell me,&#8221;
he inquired of Lynch, whom he found in the bunk-house
with McCabe. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to get this letter off
as soon as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Balancing the envelope in his hand, he held it so
that the foreman could easily read the address.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have,&#8221; returned Lynch briefly. &#8220;Looks
like that letter was heavy enough to need two.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck allowed him to weigh it in his hand for an
instant, and then, in simulated confusion, he snatched
it back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be writin&#8217; to yore girl,&#8221; grinned McCabe,
who had also been regarding the address curiously.</p>
<p>Stratton retorted in a convincingly embarrassed
fashion, received his stamps and then proffered his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
request, which was finally granted with an air of reluctance
and much grumbling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t let yuh go, only I don&#8217;t know what
the devil&#8217;s keepin&#8217; that fool Bud,&#8221; growled Lynch.
&#8220;Yuh tell the son-of-a-gun I ain&#8217;t expectin&#8217; him to
stop in town the rest of his natural life. If them
wagon-bolts ain&#8217;t come, we&#8217;ll have to do without &#8217;em.
Yuh bring him back with yuh, an&#8217; see yuh both get
here by dinner time without fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck gave the desired promise and, hastily saddling
up, departed. About three miles from the ranch, he
rode off to the side of the trail and dismounted beside
a stunted mesquite. Under its twisting branches, he
dug a hole with the toe of his boot and interred therein
Miss Florence Denby&#8217;s letter, torn into small fragments.</p>
<p>This done he swung himself into the saddle and
headed again for Paloma Springs, and as he rode he
began to whistle blithely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>COUNTERPLOT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The low-down, ornery liar!&#8221; sputtered Bud
Jessup, face flushed and eyes snapping. &#8220;He
told me to wait for them bolts if I had to stay here
all day. I thought it was kinda funny he&#8217;d let me
waste all this time, but I didn&#8217;t have no idea at all
he&#8217;d got me out of the way a-purpose to put across
that dirty deal. Why, the rotten son-of-a&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, kid,&#8221; cautioned Buck, glancing at the open
door of the store. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have Pop comin&#8217; out to
see what all the excitement&#8217;s about, and that isn&#8217;t our
game&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had found Bud alone on the rickety porch, kicking
his heels against the railing and fretting at his
enforced idleness; and having hitched his horse, he
lost no time in giving the youngster a brief account
of the happenings of the night before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not him,&#8221; shrugged Jessup, though he did lower
his voice a trifle. &#8220;The up train&#8217;s due in less than
half an hour, an&#8217; Pop&#8217;s gettin&#8217; the mail-bag ready.
That means readin&#8217; all the post-cards twice at least,
an&#8217; makin&#8217; out all he can through the envelopes, if the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
paper&#8217;s thin enough. I often wondered why he
didn&#8217;t go the whole hog an&#8217; have a kettle ready to
steam the flaps open, he seems to get so much pleasure
out of other people&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton chuckled. This suited him perfectly up to
a certain point. He pulled the letter out of his shirt
and was pleased to see that none of the writing was
visible. Then he displayed the face of the envelope
to his companion.</p>
<p>Bud&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;Whew!&#8221; he whistled. &#8220;That
sure looks like business. What&#8217;s up, Buck? Can&#8217;t
yuh tell a man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will on the way back; no time just now. Let&#8217;s
go in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way into the store and walked down to
where Daggett was slowly sorting a small pile of
letters and post-cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Pop!&#8221; he greeted. &#8220;Looks like I was just
in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man peered over the tops of his spectacles.
&#8220;Yuh be, if yuh want to catch the up-mail,&#8221; he nodded.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s it to?&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the letter from Stratton&#8217;s extended hand
and studied it with frank interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Hardenberg!&#8221; he commented. &#8220;Wal! Wal!
Friend of yores, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know as you&#8217;d hardly call him that,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
evaded Stratton. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen him in over two
years, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop waited expectantly, but no further information
was forthcoming. He eyed the letter curiously,
man&oelig;uvering as if by accident to hold it up against
the light. He even tried, by obvious methods, to get
rid of the two punchers, but they persisted in hanging
around until at length the near approach of the
train-hour forced the old man to drop the letter into
the mail-bag with the others and snap the lock. On
the plea of seeing whether their package had come,
both Stratton and Jessup escorted him over to the
station platform and did not quit his side until the
train had departed, carrying the mail-sack with it.</p>
<p>There were a few odds and ends of mail for the
Shoe-Bar, but no parcel. When this became certain,
Bud got his horse and the two mounted in front of
the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;By gee!&#8221; exclaimed Pop suddenly as they were on
the point of riding off. &#8220;I clean forgot to tell yuh.
They got blackleg over to the T-T&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both men turned abruptly in their saddles and
stared at him in dismay. To the bred-in-the-bone
rancher the mention of blackleg, that deadly contagious
and most fatal of cattle diseases, is almost as
startling as bubonic plague would be to the average
human.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; ejaculated Bud forcefully. &#8220;Yuh sure
about that, Pop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sartain sure,&#8221; nodded the old man. &#8220;One of their
men, Bronc Tippets, was over here last night an&#8217; told
me. Said their yearlings is dyin&#8217; off like flies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sure is mighty hard luck,&#8221; remarked Jessup
as they rode out of town. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad this outfit ain&#8217;t
any nearer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere off to the west of the Shoe-Bar, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; asked Stratton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. &#8217;Way the other side of the mountains.
There&#8217;s a short cut through the hills that comes out
around the north end of middle pasture, but there
ain&#8217;t one steer in a thousand could find his way
through. Well, let&#8217;s hear what you&#8217;re up to, old
man. I&#8217;m plumb interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s serious expression relaxed and he promptly
launched into a detailed explanation of his scheme.
When he had made everything clear Bud&#8217;s face lit
up and he regarded his friend admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;By cripes, Buck!&#8221; he exclaimed delightedly. &#8220;That
sure oughta work. When are yuh goin&#8217; to spring it
on &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First good chance I get,&#8221; returned Buck. &#8220;The
sooner the better, so they won&#8217;t have time to try any
more dirty work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The opportunity was not long in coming. They
reached the ranch just before dinner and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
the meal was over learned that the afternoon was to
be devoted to repairing the telephone leading from
the ranch-house to Las Vegas camp, which had been
out of order for several weeks. As certain fence
wires were utilized for line purposes, this meant considerable
work, if Stratton could judge by the ruinous
condition of most of those he had seen. He wondered
not a little at the meaning of the move, but did not
allow his curiosity to interfere with the project he
had in mind.</p>
<p>They had left the ranch in a bunch, Kreeger and
Siegrist alone remaining behind for some other purpose.
They had not gone more than two miles when
a remark of McCabe&#8217;s on mining claims gave Buck
his cue.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fellow who goes into that game with a bunch
takes a lot of chances,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;I knew a
chap once who came mighty near being croaked,
to say nothing of losing a valuable claim, by being
too confiding with a gang he thought could be
trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221; inquired Slim amiably, as Stratton
paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wanted the whole hog instead of being contented
with their share, and tried two or three times
to get this fellow&mdash;er&mdash;Brown. When Brown wised
up to what was going on he thought at first he&#8217;d
have to pull out to save his hide. But just in time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
he doped out a scheme to stop their dirty work, and
it sure was a slick one, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck chuckled retrospectively. Though the pause
was unbroken by any questions, he saw that he had
the complete and undivided attention of his audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;What he did,&#8221; resumed Stratton, &#8220;was to write
out a detailed account of all the things they&#8217;d tried
to put across, one of which was an attempt to&mdash;a&mdash;shoot
him in his bunk while he was asleep. He sealed
that up in an envelope and sent it to the sheriff with
a note asking him to keep it safe, but not to open it
unless the writer, Brown, got bumped off in some
violent way or disappeared, in which case the sheriff
was to act on the information in it and nab the crooks.
After he&#8217;d got word of its receipt, he up and told the
others what he&#8217;d done. Pretty cute, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The brief pause that followed was tense and fraught
with suppressed emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it work?&#8221; McCabe at length inquired, with
elaborate casualness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. The gang didn&#8217;t dare raise a finger to
him. They might have put a bullet through him any
time, or a knife, and made a safe get-away, but then
they&#8217;d have had to desert the claims, which wasn&#8217;t
their game at all. Darn good stunt to remember,
ain&#8217;t it, if a person ever got up against that sort of
thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no direct reply to the half-question, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Buck shot a glance at his companions. Lynch rode
slightly behind him and was out of the line of vision.
McCabe, with face averted, bent over fussing with
his saddle-strings. The sight of Doc Peters&#8217;s face,
however, pale, strained, with wide, frightened eyes
and sagging jaw, told Stratton that his thrust had
penetrated as deeply as he could have hoped.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll start here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Lynch&#8217;s voice, curt and harsh, that broke
the odd silence as he jerked his horse up and dismounted.
&#8220;Get yore tools out an&#8217; don&#8217;t waste any
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no mistaking his mood, and in the hours
that followed he was a far from agreeable taskmaster.
He snapped and growled and swore at them impartially,
acting generally like a bear with a sore ear
whom nothing can please. If he could be said to be
less disagreeable to anyone, it was, curiously enough,
Bud Jessup, whom he kept down at one end of the
line most of the afternoon. Later Stratton discovered
the reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;It worked fine,&#8221; Bud whispered to him jubilantly,
when they were alone together for a few minutes
after supper. &#8220;Did yuh see him hangin&#8217; around me
this afternoon? He was grouchin&#8217; around and pretendin&#8217;
to be mad because he&#8217;d let yuh go to town
this mornin&#8217; just to mail a letter to some fool girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I pulled the baby stare an&#8217; told him I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
didn&#8217;t see no letter to no girl. Yuh sure didn&#8217;t mail
one while I was with yuh, I says.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Didn&#8217;t mail no letter at all?&#8217; he wants to know,
scowlin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sure,&#8217; I says. &#8216;Only it went to Jim Hardenberg
over to Perilla. I seen him hand it to old Pop
Daggett, who was peevish as a wet hen &#8217;cause he
couldn&#8217;t find out nothin&#8217; about what was in it, &#8217;count
of Buck hangin&#8217; around till it got on the train. That&#8217;s
the only letter I seen.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t have no more to say, but walked off,
scowlin&#8217; fierce. I&#8217;ll bet yuh my new Stetson to a
two-bit piece, Buck, he rides in to town mighty quick
to find out what Pop knows about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton did not take him up, for it had already
occurred to him that such a move on Lynch&#8217;s part was
almost certain. As a matter of fact the foreman
did leave the ranch early the next morning, driving
a pair of blacks harnessed to the buckboard. Buck
and Jessup were both surprised at this unwonted
method of locomotion, which usually indicated a passenger
to be brought back, or, more rarely, a piece of
freight or express, too large or heavy to be carried
on horseback, yet not bulky enough for the lumbering
freight-wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; if it was freight, he&#8217;d have sent one of us,&#8221;
commented Bud, as they saddled up preparatory to
resuming operations on the fences. &#8220;Still an&#8217; all,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
I reckon he wants to see Pop himself and get a line
on what that old he-gossip knows. He&#8217;ll have his
ear full, all right,&#8221; he finished in a tone of vindictive
satisfaction.</p>
<p>To make up for the day before, the whole gang
took life very easily, and knocked off work rather
earlier than usual. They had loafed ten or fifteen
minutes in the bunk-house and were straggling up the
slope in answer to Pedro&#8217;s summons to dinner when,
with a clatter of hoofs, the blacks whirled through the
further gate and galloped toward the house.</p>
<p>Buck, among the others, glanced curiously in that
direction and observed with much interest that a
woman occupied the front seat of the buckboard with
Tex, while a young man and two small trunks more
than filled the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some dame!&#8221; he heard Bud mutter under his
breath.</p>
<p>A moment later Lynch pulled up the snorting team
and called Jessup to hold them. Buck was just turning
away from a lightning appraisal of the new-comers,
when, to his amazement, the young woman smiled at
him from her seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Green!&#8221; she called out in surprise. &#8220;To
think of finding you here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck stared at her, wide-eyed and bewildered.
With her crisp, dark hair, fresh color, and regular
features, she was very good to look at. But he had
never consciously set eyes on her before in all his life!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE LADY FROM THE PAST</h3>
</div>

<p>Stratton&#8217;s first feeling was that the girl must
have made a mistake. In a dazed fashion he
stepped forward and helped her out of the buckboard,
but this was a more or less mechanical action and
because she so evidently expected it. As he took her
hand she pressed it warmly and did not at once relinquish
it after she had reached the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully glad to see you again,&#8221; she said, her
color heightened a little. &#8220;But how on earth do you
come to be away off here?&#8221;</p>
<p>With an effort Buck pulled himself together. He
could see that the men were regarding him curiously,
and felt that he must say something.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s simple enough,&#8221; he answered briefly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a job on this ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked slightly puzzled. &#8220;Really? But I
thought&mdash;I had no idea you knew&mdash;Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t. I needed a job and drifted in here
thinking I&#8217;d find a friend of mine who used to work
on the same outfit in Texas. He was gone, but Miss
Thorne took me on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;re a regular cow-boy?&#8221; the girl
asked in surprise. &#8220;Why, you never told me that
aboard ship?&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden chill swept over Stratton, and for a moment
he was stricken speechless. Aboard ship! Was
it possible that this girl had been part of that uncanny,
vanished year, the very thought of which troubled
and oppressed him. His glance desperately evaded
her charming, questioning eyes and rested suddenly
with a curious cool sense of relief on the face of
Mary Thorne, who had come up unperceived from
behind.</p>
<p>But as their eyes met Buck was conscious of an
odd veiled expression in their clear depths which
vaguely troubled him. It vanished quickly as
Miss Thorne moved quickly forward to embrace her
friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stella!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m so awfully glad to see
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were kisses and renewed embracings; the
young man was greeted more decorously but with
almost equal warmth, and then suddenly Miss Thorne
turned to Stratton, who stood back a little, struggling
between a longing to escape and an equally strong
desire to find out a little more about this attractive
but startling reminder of his unknown past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no idea you knew Miss Manning,&#8221; she said,
with the faintest hint of stiffness in her manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Buck swallowed hard but was saved from further
embarrassment by the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; she said brightly. &#8220;We came home on
the same ship. Mr. Green had been wounded, you
know, and was under my care. We got to be&mdash;great
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was there a touch of meaning in the last two words?
Stratton preferred to lay it to his imagination, and
was glad of the diversion caused by the introduction of
the young man, who proved to be Miss Manning&#8217;s
brother. Buck was not at all impressed by the fellow&#8217;s
handsome face, athletic figure, and immaculate clothes.
The clothes especially seemed ridiculously out of place
for even a visitor on a ranch, and he had always detested
those dinky half-shaved mustaches.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the trunks had been carried in and the
team led away, and Pedro was peevishly complaining
from the kitchen door that dinner was getting cold.
Buck learned that the visitors were from Chicago,
where they had been close friends of the Thorne family
for years, and then he managed to break away and join
the fellows in the kitchen.</p>
<p>During the meal there was a lot of more or less
quiet joking on the subject of Stratton&#8217;s acquaintance
with the lady, which he managed to parry rather
cleverly. As a matter of fact the acute horror he felt
at the very thought of the truth about himself getting
out, quickened his wits and kept him constantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
on his guard. He kept his temper and his head, explaining
calmly that Miss Manning had been one of
the nurses detailed to look after the batch of wounded
men of whom he had been one. Naturally he had
seen considerable of her during the long and tedious
voyage, but there were one or two others he liked
equally well.</p>
<p>His careless manner seemed to convince the men
that there was no particular amusement to be extracted
from the situation, and to Buck&#8217;s relief they passed
on to a general discussion of strangers on a ranch,
the bother they were, and the extra amount of work
they made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always wantin&#8217; to ride around with yuh an&#8217; see
what&#8217;s goin&#8217; on,&#8221; declared Butch Siegrist sourly.
&#8220;If they&#8217;re wimmin, yuh can&#8217;t even give a cuss without
lookin&#8217; first to see if they&#8217;re near enough to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton made a mental resolution that if anything
of that sort came up, he would do his best to duck
the job of playing cicerone to Miss Stella Manning,
attractive as she was. So far his bluff seemed to have
worked, but with a mind so entirely blank of the
slightest detail of their acquaintance, he knew that
at any moment the most casual remark might serve
to rouse her suspicion.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his desire to remain in the background
was abetted by Tex Lynch. Whether or not the foreman
wanted to keep him away from the ranch-owner&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
friends as well as from Miss Thorne herself, Buck
could not quite determine. But while the fence-repairing
progressed, Stratton was never by any chance
detailed to other duties which might keep him in the
neighborhood of the ranch-house, and on the one
occasion when Miss Thorne and her guests rode out
to where the men were working, Lynch saw to it
that there was no opportunity for anything like private
conversation between them and the object of his
solicitude.</p>
<p>Buck watched his man&oelig;uvering with secret amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t he be wild if he knew he was playing
right into my hands?&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>His face darkened as he glanced thoughtfully at
the departing figure of Miss Manning. She had
greeted him warmly and betrayed a very evident inclination
to linger in his vicinity. There had been
a slight touch of pique in her treatment of Lynch,
who hung around so persistently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to thunder I had an idea of how much
she knows,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Did I act like a brainless
idiot when I was&mdash;was that way, or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had asked the same question of the hospital
surgeon and got an unsatisfactory answer. It all depended,
the doctor told him non-committally. He
might easily have shown evidences of lost memory;
on the other hand, it was quite possible, especially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
with chance acquaintances, that his manner had been
entirely normal.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be gained, however, by racking
his brain for something that wasn&#8217;t there, and
Buck soon gave up the attempt. He could only trust
to luck and his own inventiveness, and hope that
Lynch&#8217;s delightfully unconscious easing of the situation
would continue.</p>
<p>The work was finished toward noon on the third
day after the arrival of the Mannings, and all the
connections hooked up. There remained nothing to
do but test the line, and Tex, after making sure everything
was in order, glanced over his men, who lounged
in front of the Las Vegas shack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh may as well stay down at this end,&#8221; he remarked,
looking at Buck, &#8220;while the rest of us go back.
Stick around where yuh can hear the bell, an&#8217; if it
don&#8217;t ring in, say, an hour, try to get the house yourself.
If that don&#8217;t work, come along in an&#8217; report. I
reckon everything&#8217;s all right, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton was conscious of a sudden sense of alertness.
He had grown so used to suspecting and analyzing
everything the foreman said or did that for a
moment he forgot the precautions he had taken and
wondered whether Lynch was up to some new crooked
work. Then he remembered and relaxed mentally.
Considering the consequences, Tex would hardly dare
try any fresh violence against him, especially quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
so soon. Besides, in broad daylight and in this open
country, Buck couldn&#8217;t imagine any form of danger
he wouldn&#8217;t be able to meet successfully alone.</p>
<p>So he acquiesced indifferently, and from the open
doorway of the hut watched the others mount and
ride away. There were only four of them, for Kreeger
and Butch Siegrist had been dispatched early that
morning to ride fence on the other side of the ranch-house.
When they were well on their way, Buck untied
his lunch from the saddle and went into the shack
to eat it.</p>
<p>In spite of the feeling that he had nothing to fear,
he took a position which gave him a good outlook
from both door and window, and saw that his gun
was loose in the holster. After he had eaten, he went
down and got a drink from the creek. He had
not been back in the shack a great while before the
telephone bell jangled, and taking down the receiver
he heard Lynch&#8217;s voice at the other end.</p>
<p>Owing to the rather crude nature of the contrivance
there was a good deal of buzzing on the line. But
this was to be expected, and when Tex had talked
a few minutes and decided that the system was working
as well as could be hoped, he told Stratton to
come in to the ranch, and hung up.</p>
<p>Buck had not ridden more than a quarter of a mile
across the prairie, when all at once he pulled his horse
to a standstill. The thought had suddenly come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
him that this was the chance he had wanted so long to
take a look at that mysterious stretch of desert known
as the north pasture. He would be delayed, of
course, but explanations were easy and that did not
disturb him. It was too good an opportunity to miss,
and without delay he turned his horse and spurred
forward.</p>
<p>An instinct of caution made him keep as close as
possible to the rough, broken country that edged the
western extremity of the ranch, where he would run
less chance of being seen than on the flat, open plain.
He pushed his horse as much as was wise, and presently
observed with satisfaction&mdash;though it was still
a good way off&mdash;the line of fence that marked the
northern boundary of middle pasture.</p>
<p>A few hundred yards ahead lay a shallow draw,
and beyond it a weather-worn ridge thrust its blunt
nose out into the plain considerably further than any
Buck had yet passed. He turned the horse out, intending
to ride around it, but a couple of minutes
later jerked him to a standstill and sat motionless in
the saddle, eyes narrowing with a sudden, keen surprise.</p>
<p>He had reached a point where, for the first time,
he could make out, over the obstruction ahead, the
extreme northwest corner of the pasture. Almost
at the spot where the two lines of fence made a right
angle were two horsemen in the typical cow-man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
attire. At first they stood close together, but as Stratton
stared intently, rising a little in his stirrups to get
a clearer view through the scanty fringe of vegetation
that topped the ridge, one of them rode forward
and, dismounting, began to manipulate the fence wires
with quick, jerky movements of his hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;BLACKLEG&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>More than once during the next ten minutes
Buck cursed himself inwardly for not having
brought along the small but powerful pair of field-glasses
that were tucked away in his bag. He had
picked them up at the Divisional Headquarters only
a week or two before the Belleau Woods business, and
how they had stuck to him until his arrival in America
remained one of the minor mysteries of that vanished
year. He would have given anything for them
now, for though he could make out fairly well the
movements of the two men, he was too far away to
distinguish their faces.</p>
<p>Watching closely, he saw that the first fellow was
taking down a short section of the fence, either by
cutting or by pulling out the staples. When this lay
flat he remounted and, joining his companion, the
two proceeded to drive through the gap nothing more
significant than a solitary steer.</p>
<p>It was a yearling, Buck could easily see even at
that distance, and he almost laughed aloud at the
sudden let-down of suspense. By this time a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
individual trick of carriage made him suspect that
the foremost puncher was Butch Siegrist, and when
the men came into clearer view, he recognized scarcely
without question the big sorrel with white trimmings
on which Kreeger had ridden off that morning. The
two men had found a Shoe-Bar stray; that was all.
And yet, on second thought, how did they come to
be here when they were supposed to be working at
the very opposite extremity of the ranch?</p>
<p>It was this query which made Stratton refrain
from showing himself. With considerable annoyance,
for time was passing, he waited where he was
until the two men had gone back through the gap
in the fence and restored the wires. He watched
them turn northward and ride rapidly across the sandy
waste until at length their diminishing figures disappeared
into the distance. Even then it was ten
or fifteen minutes before he emerged from his seclusion,
and when he finally did he headed straight for
the young steer, who had been the cause of so much
exertion on the part of the two men who ordinarily
shirked work whenever they could.</p>
<p>Under the lash of a rope, the animal had lumbered
across the pasture for several hundred yards, where
he paused languidly to crunch some bunch-grass.
There was an air of lassitude and weakness about
the creature which made Buck, as he approached, eye
it with anxious intentness. A dozen feet or so away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
he jerked his horse to a standstill and caught his
breath with an odd whistling sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Godfrey!&#8221; he breathed.</p>
<p>Bending slightly forward in the saddle, he stared
at the creature&#8217;s badly-swollen off hind leg, but there
was no need whatever for a prolonged inspection.
Having been through one blackleg epidemic back in
Texas, he knew the signs only too well.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, sure enough,&#8221; he muttered, straightening
up.</p>
<p>His gaze swept across the prairie to where, half
a mile away, a bunch of Shoe-Bar cattle grazed peacefully.
If this sick beast should get amongst them,
the yearlings at least, to whom the disease is fatal,
would be dying like flies in twenty-four hours. Buck
glanced back at the steer again, and as he noted the
T-T brand, his face hardened and he began taking
down his rope.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hellions!&#8221; he grated, an angry flush darkening
his tan. &#8220;They ought to be strung up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The animal started to move away, and Buck lost no
time in roping him. Then he turned his horse and
urged him toward the fence, dragging the reluctant
brute behind. Fortunately he had his pliers in the
saddle-pocket, and, taking down the wires, he forced
the creature through and headed for a deep gully the
mouth of which lay a few hundred yards to the left.
Penetrating into this as far as he was able, he took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
out his Colt and deliberately shot the steer through
the head. And if Kreeger or Siegrist had been present
at that moment, he was furious enough to treat
either of them in the same way without a particle of
compunction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hanging would be too good for them, the dirty
beasts!&#8221; he grated.</p>
<p>The thing had been so fiendishly cold-blooded and
calculating that it made his blood boil, for it was
perfectly evident now to Buck that he had thwarted
a deliberate plot to introduce the blackleg scourge
among the Shoe-Bar cattle. Instead of riding fence,
the two punchers must have made their roundabout
way immediately to the stricken T-T ranch, secured
in some manner an infected yearling and brought it
back through the twisting mountain trail Bud had
spoken of a few days before.</p>
<p>Lynch&#8217;s was the directing spirit, of course; for
none of the others would dare act save under his
orders. But what was his object? What could he
possibly hope to gain by such a thing? Buck could
understand a man allowing rustlers to loot a ranch,
if the same individual were in with them secretly and
shared the plunder. But there was no profit in this
for anyone&mdash;only an infinite amount of trouble and
worry and extra work for them all, to say nothing
of great financial loss to&mdash;Mary Thorne.</p>
<p>When Stratton had secured his rope and rode back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
to the Shoe-Bar pasture, his face was thoughtful.
He was thinking of those excellent offers for the
outfit Miss Thorne had lately spoken of, which Lynch
was so anxious for her to accept. Could the foreman&#8217;s
plotting be for the purpose of forcing her to
sell? From something she had let fall, Buck guessed
that she was more or less dependent on the income
from the ranch, and if this failed she might no longer
be able to hold the property.</p>
<p>But even supposing this was true, it all still failed
to make sense. The land itself was good enough,
as Stratton knew from his former careful inspections,
but it would be of little use for any purpose save
ranching; and since the value of a cattle-ranch consists
largely in the cattle themselves, it followed
logically that by reducing the number, by theft, by
disease, or any other means, the value would be very
much less to a prospective purchaser.</p>
<p>Unable to make head or tail of the problem, Buck
finally gave it up for the time being. He put back
the fence with care and then headed straight for the
ranch. There was no time left for the desired inspection
of the north pasture. To undertake it now
would mean a much longer delay than he could plausibly
explain, and he was particularly anxious to avoid
the need of any explanation which might arouse
suspicion that the criminal action of the two men had
been overseen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If they guessed, they&#8217;d be likely to try it again,&#8221;
he thought, &#8220;and another time they might succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton managed his route so that for the last two
miles it took exactly the course he would have
followed in returning directly from Las Vegas camp.
His plan was further favored by the discovery that
none of the men save Bud were anywhere about the
ranch-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone off to ride fence along with Flint an&#8217; Butch,&#8221;
Jessup informed him, when Buck located him in the
wagon-shed. &#8220;Wonder why he&#8217;s so awful interested
in fences all of a sudden,&#8221; he went on thoughtfully.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve been let go all over the ranch till they&#8217;re
plumb fallin&#8217; to pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me,&#8221; shrugged Stratton. He had
been cogitating whether or not to confide in Bud, and
finally decided in the negative. It would do no particular
good, and the youngster might impulsively let
out something to the others. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they take
you along, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure wish they had,&#8221; Bud answered shortly.
&#8220;Then I wouldn&#8217;t of had to be lookin&#8217; at that all
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>He straightened from the wagon-body he was tinkering
and waved a wrench toward the window behind
Stratton. Turning quickly, the latter saw that it
looked out on the rear of the ranch-house, where
there were a few stunted trees and a not altogether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
successful attempt at a small flower-garden. On a
rough, rustic bench under one of the trees sat young
Manning and Mary Thorne, in earnest conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sickening, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; commented Bud, taking encouragement
from Stratton&#8217;s involuntary frown. &#8220;I
been expectin&#8217; &#8217;em to hold hands any minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck laughed, mainly because he was annoyed with
himself for feeling any emotion whatever. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t seem to like Mr. Alfred Manning,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would?&#8221; snorted Jessup. &#8220;He sure gets my
goat, with them dude clothes, an&#8217; that misplaced piece
of eyebrow on his lip, an&#8217; his superior airs. I
wouldn&#8217;t of thought Miss Mary was the kind to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Manning?&#8221; broke in Buck,
reluctant to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone in with Mrs. Archer,&#8221; Bud explained, &#8220;They
was both out there a while ago, but I reckon they got
tired hangin&#8217; around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton turned his back on the dingy window and
fell to work on the wagon with Bud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen Bemis lately?&#8221; he asked presently, realizing
of a sudden that he had not visited the invalid for
several days.</p>
<p>Bud sniffed. &#8220;Sure. I was in there this mornin&#8217;.
He&#8217;s outa bed now moochin&#8217; around the room an&#8217;
countin&#8217; the hours till he can back a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still got that notion the outfit isn&#8217;t safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell the world! He says life&#8217;s too short to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
take any more chances of bein&#8217; bumped off. Tried
to make me believe my turn&#8217;ll come next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;I reckon there
isn&#8217;t much chance of that. They&#8217;re not keen to get
the sheriff down on their trail. Well, if he feels like
that he wouldn&#8217;t be much use here even if we could
persuade him to stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>About half-past five they decided to call it a day
and went down to the bunk-house, through the open
door of which Buck presently observed the arrival
of the remainder of the outfit. They came from the
east, and Kreeger and Siegrist were with them. As
Buck expected, the former rode the sorrel with distinctive
white markings, while the latter bestrode a nondescript
bay. The second of the two riders he had
watched that afternoon had been mounted on just such
a bay, and if there had been a lingering touch of doubt
in Stratton&#8217;s mind as to the identity of the two criminals,
it remained no longer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE UNEXPECTED</h3>
</div>

<p>More than once during the following few days,
Stratton was forced to a grudging admiration,
of Tex Lynch&#8217;s cleverness. Even knowing what he
did, he failed to detect the slightest sign in either
the foreman or his men that they were waiting expectantly
for something to happen. The only significant
feature was their marked avoidance of the
middle pasture. This might readily be accounted
for by the fact that the work now lay on the other
side of the outfit, but Buck was convinced that their
real purpose was to allow the blackleg scourge to gain
as great a hold as possible on Shoe-Bar cattle before
its discovery.</p>
<p>The cold-blooded brutality of that quiescence made
Stratton furious, but it also brought home more effectually
than ever the nature of the men he had to deal
with. They were evidently the sort to stop at nothing,
and Buck had moments of wondering whether or not
he was proceeding in the right way to uncover the
mystery of their motive.</p>
<p>So far he had really accomplished very little. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
unabated watchfulness of the crowd so hedged in and
hampered him that it was quite impossible to do any
extended investigating. He still had the power of
ending the whole affair at any moment and clearing
the ranch of the entire gang. But aside from his
unwillingness to humiliate Mary Thorne, he realized
that this would not necessarily accomplish what he
wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would stop their deviltry all right,&#8221; he thought
&#8220;but I might never find out what they&#8217;re after.
About the only way is to give &#8217;em enough rope to
hang themselves, and I&#8217;m blowed if I don&#8217;t believe
I could do that better by leaving the outfit and doing
a little sleuthing on my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet somehow that did not altogether appeal to him,
either. The presence of handsome Alf Manning may
have had something to do with Buck&#8217;s reluctance to
quit the ranch just now, but he would never have
admitted it, even to himself. He simply made up his
mind to wait a while, at least until he could see what
happened when Lynch discovered the failure of his
latest plot, and then be governed by circumstances.</p>
<p>In the meantime the situation, so far as Miss Manning,
was concerned, grew daily more complicated. She
showed a decided inclination for Stratton&#8217;s society,
and when he came to know her better he found her
frank, breezy, and delightfully companionable. He
knew perfectly well that unless he wanted to take a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
chance of making some tremendous blunder he ought
to avoid any prolonged conversation with the lady.
But she was so charming that every now and then
he flung prudence to the winds&mdash;and usually regretted
it.</p>
<p>It was not that she said anything definitely disconcerting,
but there were occasional hints and innuendoes,
and now and then a question which seemed innocent
enough but which Stratton found difficult to
parry. He couldn&#8217;t quite make up his mind whether
or not she suspected the truth about his former mental
condition, but he had an uncomfortable notion that
she sensed a difference and was trying to find out
just where it lay.</p>
<p>Time and again he told himself that at the worst
there was nothing disgraceful in that vanished past.
But he had the ordinary healthy man&#8217;s horror for the
abnormal, and the very fact that it had vanished so
utterly beyond recall made him willing, in order to
avoid having it dragged back into the light and made
public property, to do almost anything, even to being
almost rude to a pretty girl.</p>
<p>Thus between escaping Miss Manning and trying
to keep an eye on Lynch, Stratton had his work cut
out for him. He knew that sooner or later some one
would be sent out to take a look through the middle
pasture, and he wanted very much to be on hand
when the report came back to Lynch that his plot had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
miscarried. It was consequently with very bad grace
that Buck received an order to ride in to Paloma
one morning for the long-delayed wagon-bolts and
a few necessary supplies from the store.</p>
<p>He felt at once that it was a put-up job to get him
out of the way. Only yesterday Rick Bemis, able
at length to ride that distance, had quit the ranch
escorted by Slim McCabe. If anything was really
needed the latter could have brought it back and saved
the expense of sending another man twenty-four
hours later.</p>
<p>But there was no reasonable excuse for Buck&#8217;s protesting,
and he held his tongue. He wished that he
had taken Jessup into his confidence about the blackleg
plot, but there was no time for that now. He
did manage, on his way to the corral, to whisper a
word or two in passing, urging the youngster to take
particular note of anything that went on during his
absence, but he would have much preferred giving
Bud some definite idea of what to look for, and his
humor, as he saddled up and left the ranch, was far
from amiable.</p>
<p>But gradually, as he rode rapidly along the trail,
the crisp, clean air brushing his face and the early
morning sun caressing him with a pleasant warmth,
his mood changed. After all, it was really of very
little moment whether or not he was present when
Lynch first learned that things had failed to go his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
way. At best he might have had a momentary vindictive
thrill at glimpsing the fellow&#8217;s thwarted rage;
perhaps not even that, for Tex was uncommonly good
at hiding his emotions. It was much more important
for him to decide definitely and soon about
his own future plans, and this solitary ride over an
easy, familiar trail gave him as good a chance as he
was ever likely to have.</p>
<p>A little straight thinking made him realize&mdash;with
a half-guilty feeling of having deliberately shut his
eyes to it before&mdash;that he could not hope to get much
further under present conditions. Tied down as he
was, a dozen promising clues might pop up, which he
would have no chance whatever of investigating. Indeed,
looking at the situation in this light, he felt a
wonder that Lynch should ever have tried to oust
him from the ranch, where he could be kept under constant
observation and followed up in every move.
Working from the outside, with freedom to come and
go as he liked, he could accomplish a vast deal more
than in this present hampered fashion. There still
remained traces of his vague, underlying reluctance
to leave the place at this particular time, but Buck
crushed it down firmly, even a little angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to me to quit,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I&#8217;d be
a blooming jackass to waste any more time here.
I&#8217;ll have to work it naturally, though, or Lynch will
smell a rat.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>At that moment the trail dipped down into a gully&mdash;the
very one, in fact, where he had passed Tex that
first day he had ridden out to the ranch. Thinking
of the encounter, Buck recalled his own emotions with
a curious feeling of remoteness. The grotesque mental
picture he had formed of Mary Thorne contrasted
so amusingly with the reality that he grinned and
might have broken into a laugh had he not caught
sight at that moment of a figure riding toward him
from the other end of the gully.</p>
<p>The high-crowned sombrero, abnormally broad
of brim, the gaudy saddle-trappings and touches of
bright color about the stranger&#8217;s equipment, brought
a slight frown to Stratton&#8217;s face. Apart even from
is recent unpleasant associations with them, he had
never had any great fondness for Mexicans, whom
he considered slick and slippery beyond the average.
He watched this one&#8217;s approach warily, and when the
fellow pulled up with a glistening smile and a polite
&#8220;<i>Buenas tardes</i>,&#8221; Stratton responded with some curtness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine day, señor,&#8221; remarked the stranger pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said it,&#8221; returned Buck drily. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t had rain in as much as three weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed the other. His glance strayed
to the brand on Buck&#8217;s cayuse, and his swarthy face
took on an expression of pleased surprise. &#8220;You
come from Shoe-Bar?&#8221; he questioned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re some mind-reader,&#8221; commented Stratton
briefly. &#8220;What of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe yo&#8217; do me favor,&#8221; pursued the Mexican
eagerly. &#8220;Save me plenty hot ride.&#8221; He pulled an
envelope from the pocket of his elaborately silver-conchoed
chaps. &#8220;Rocking-R boss, he tell me take
thees to Mister Leench at Shoe-Bar. Eef yo&#8217; take
heem, I am save mooch trouble, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck eyed the extended envelope doubtfully. Then,
ashamed of his momentary hesitation to perform this
simple service, he took it and tucked it away in one
pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take it over for you.
I&#8217;ve got to go in to town first, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; shrugged the Mexican. &#8220;There is
no hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>With reiterated and profuse thanks, he pulled his
horse around and rode back with Stratton as far as
the Rocking-R trail, where he turned off.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll find some corner where he can curl up and
snooze for the couple of hours he&#8217;s saved,&#8221; thought
Buck, watching the departing figure. &#8220;Those fellows,
are so dog-gone lazy they&#8217;d sit and let grasshoppers,
eat holes in their breeches.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he rode on he wondered a little what Jim Tenny,
the Rocking-R foreman, could have to do with Lynch,
who seemed to be on the outs with everybody, but
Presently he dismissed the subject with a shrug.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be getting as bad as Pop if I&#8217;m not careful&#8221;
he thought. &#8220;Likely it&#8217;s some perfectly ordinary
range business.&#8221;</p>
<p>He found Daggett in a garrulous mood but was in
no humor to waste time listening to his flood of talk
and questions. The bolts had come at last, and when
he had secured them and the other things from the
store, Buck promptly mounted and set out on his return.</p>
<p>Tex met him just outside the corral and received
the letter without comment, thrusting it into his pocket
unread. He seemed much more interested in the
arrival of the bolts, and after dinner set Stratton and
McCabe to work in the wagon-shed replacing the
broken ones. It was not until late in the afternoon
that Buck managed a few words in private with Jessup,
and was surprised to learn that the gang had been
working all day to the southeast of the ranch. Tex
himself had been absent from the party for an hour
or two in the morning, but when he joined them he
came from the direction of the Paloma trail, and Stratton
did not believe he could have had time thoroughly
to inspect the middle pasture and return so soon by
so roundabout a course.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll do it to-morrow, sure,&#8221; decided Buck. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t human nature to hold off much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right. After breakfast Stratton and
McCabe were ordered to resume work on the wagons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
while the others sallied forth with Lynch, ostensibly
to ride fence along the southern side of middle pasture.
Buck awaited their return with interest and curiosity.
He thought he might possibly detect some signs of
glumness in the faces of the foreman and his confederates,
but he was quite unprepared for the open
anger and excitement which stamped every face, Bud
Jessup&#8217;s included.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rustlers were out again last night,&#8221; Bud explained,
the moment he had a chance.</p>
<p>Buck stared at him in amazement, the totally unexpected
nature of the thing taking him completely
by surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why I thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; interrupted Bud curtly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
believe they&#8217;d dare break into middle pasture, but
they have. There&#8217;s a gap a hundred yards wide in
the fence, and they&#8217;ve got away with a couple of hundred
head at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure it happened last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead certain. The tracks are too fresh. Buck,
if Tex Lynch don&#8217;t get Hardenberg on the job now,
we&#8217;ll <i>know</i> he&#8217;s crooked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d pretty near decided that anyhow, hadn&#8217;t
we?&#8221; returned Stratton absently.</p>
<p>He was wondering how this new move had been
managed and what it meant. If it had been merely
part of a scheme to loot the Shoe-Bar for his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
benefit, Tex would never have allowed his rustler
accomplices to touch a steer from that middle pasture
herd, which he must feel by this time to be thoroughly
and completely infected. Even if he had managed
during his brief absence yesterday to make a hurried
inspection, and suspected that the blackleg&#8217; plot had
failed, he couldn&#8217;t be certain enough to take a chance
like this.</p>
<p>The foreman&#8217;s manner gave Buck no clue. At
dinner he was unusually silent and morose, taking no
part in the discussion of this latest outrage, which
the others kept up with such a convincing semblance
of indignation. To Stratton he acted like a man who
has come to some new and not altogether agreeable
decision, which in any other person would probably
mean that he had at last made up his mind to call in the
sheriff. But Buck was convinced that this was the last
thing Lynch intended to do, and gradually there grew
up in his mind, fostered by one or two trifling particulars
in Tex&#8217;s manner toward himself, a curious,
instinctive feeling of premonitory caution.</p>
<p>This increased during the afternoon, when the men
were sent out to repair the broken fence, while Lynch
remained behind. It fed on little details, such as a
chance side glance from one of the men, or the sight
of two of them in low-voiced conversation when he
was not supposed to be looking&mdash;details he would
scarcely have noticed ordinarily. Toward the end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
the day Buck had grown almost certain that some fresh
move was being directed against himself, and when
the blow fell only its nature came as a surprise.</p>
<p>The foreman was standing near the corral when they
returned, and as soon as Stratton had unsaddled
and turned his horse loose, Lynch drew him to
one side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your time up to to-night,&#8221; he said curtly,
holding out a handful of crumpled bills and silver.
&#8220;Miss Thorne&#8217;s decided she don&#8217;t want yuh on the
outfit any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Stratton regarded the foreman in
silence, observing the glint of veiled triumph in his
eyes and the malicious curve of the full red lips. The
thought flashed through his mind that Lynch would
hardly be quite so pleased if he knew how much
time Buck himself had given lately to thinking up some
scheme of plausibly bringing about this very situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Is</i> that so?&#8221; he drawled presently. &#8220;How did you
work it?&#8221; he added, in the casual tone of one seeking
to gratify a trifling curiosity.</p>
<p>Lynch scowled. &#8220;Work it?&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t have to work it. Yuh know damn well why
you&#8217;re sacked. Why should I waste time tellin&#8217; yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton smiled blandly. &#8220;In that case I reckon
I&#8217;ll have to ask Miss Thorne,&#8221; he remarked, standing
with legs slightly apart and thumbs hooked loosely
in his chap-belt. &#8220;I&#8217;m rather curious, you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Like hell yuh will!&#8221; rasped Lynch, as Buck took
a step or two toward the house.</p>
<p>Impulsively Lynch&#8217;s right hand dropped to his gun
but as his fingers touched the stock he found himself
staring at the uptilted end of Stratton&#8217;s holster
frayed a little at the end so that the glint of a blued
steel barrel showed through the leather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just move your hand a mite,&#8221; Buck suggested in
a quiet, level tone, which was nevertheless obeyed
promptly. &#8220;Now, listen here. I want you to get
this. I ain&#8217;t longing to stick around any outfit when
the boss don&#8217;t want me. If the lady says I&#8217;m to go,
I&#8217;ll get out <i>pronto</i>; but I don&#8217;t trust you, and she&#8217;s
got to tell me that face to face before I move a step.
<i>Sabe?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed slightly, and Lynch, crumpling
the unheeded money in his hand, stepped aside with
an expression of baffled fury and watched him stride
along the side of the house and disappear around the
corner.</p>
<p>He was far from lacking nerve, but he had suddenly
remembered that letter to Sheriff Hardenberg,
regarding which he had long ago obtained confirmation
from Pop Daggett. If he could rely on the meaning
of Stratton&#8217;s little anecdote&mdash;and he had an uncomfortable
conviction that he could&mdash;the letter would
be opened in case Buck met his death by violence.
And once it was opened by the sheriff, only Tex Lynch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
how very much the fat would be in the fire.</p>
<p>So, though his fingers twitched, he held his hand,
and presently, hearing voices in the living-room, he
crept over to an open window and, standing close to
one side of it, bent his head to listen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE PRIMEVAL INSTINCT</h3>
</div>

<p>On the other side of the house Buck found the
mistress of the ranch and her two guests standing
in a little group beside one of the dusty, discouraged-looking
flower-beds. As he appeared they all
glanced toward him, and a troubled, almost frightened
expression flashed across Mary Thorne&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I speak to you a moment, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; asked
Stratton, doffing his Stetson.</p>
<p>That expression, and her marked hesitation in coming
forward, were both significant, and Buck felt a
sudden little stab of anger. Was she afraid of him?
he wondered; and tried to imagine what beastly lies
Lynch must have told her to bring about such an extraordinary
state of mind.</p>
<p>But as she moved slowly toward him, the anger
ebbed as swiftly as it had come. She looked so slight
and frail and girlish, and he observed that her lips
were pressed almost as tightly together as the fingers
of those small, brown hands hanging straight at her
sides. At the edge of the porch she paused and looked
up at him, and though the startled look had gone, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
could see that she was still nervous and apprehensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should you rather go inside?&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>Buck flashed a glance at the two Mannings, still
within hearing. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; he answered
briefly.</p>
<p>In the living-room she turned and faced him, her
back against the table, on which she rested the tips
of her outspread fingers. She was so evidently nerving
herself for an interview she dreaded that Buck
almost regretted having forced it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t keep you a minute,&#8221; he began hurriedly.
&#8220;Tex tells me you have no more use for me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;sorry,&#8221; fell almost mechanically from her
set lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t tell me why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes, which from the first had scarcely left his
face, widened, and a puzzled look came into them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must know,&#8221; she returned a trifle stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he assured her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;duties!&#8221; She spoke with a touch of soft impatience. &#8220;It&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve
done, not what you haven&#8217;t done that&mdash;. But surely this is a waste of
time? It&#8217;s not particularly&mdash;pleasant; and I don&#8217;t see what will be gained
by going into all the&mdash;the details.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in her tone stung him. &#8220;Still, it doesn&#8217;t
seem quite fair to condemn even a common
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
cow-puncher unheard,&#8221; he retorted with a touch of sarcasm.</p>
<p>She stiffened, and a faint flush crept into her face.
Then her chin went up determinedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You rode to Paloma yesterday morning.&#8221; It was
more of a statement than a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the gully this side of the Rocking-R trail you
met a Mexican on a sorrel horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Buck acquiesced, but inwardly he wondered.
So far as he knew there had been no witness to that
meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;He handed you a letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck nodded, a sudden feeling of puzzled wariness
surging over him. For an instant the girl hesitated.
Then she went on in a soft rush of indignation:</p>
<p>&#8220;And so last night those Mexican thieves, warned
that the middle pasture would be unguarded, broke
in there and carried off nearly two hundred head of
cattle!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he caught her meaning, which he did almost
instantly, Buck flushed crimson and his eyes flashed.
For a moment or so he was too furious to speak; and
though most of his rage was directed against the man
who, with such brazen effrontery, had sought to shift
the blame of his own criminal plotting, he could not
help feeling resentment that the girl should so readily
believe the worst against him. A vehement denial
trembled on his lips, but in time he remembered that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
he could not utter it without giving away more than
he was willing to at the present moment. With an effort
he got a grip on himself, but though his voice was
quiet enough, his eyes still smoldered and his lips were
hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he commented briefly. &#8220;You believe it all,
of course?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had been watching him closely, and now a touch
of troubled uncertainty crept into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What else can I do?&#8221; she countered. &#8220;You admit
getting the letter from that Mexican, and I saw Tex
take it out of your bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>This information brought Buck&#8217;s lips tightly together
and he frowned. &#8220;Could I see it&mdash;the letter,
I mean?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, and then, reaching across
the table, took up the shabby account-book he had seen
before and drew from it a single sheet of paper. The
note was short and written in Spanish. It was headed,
&#8220;<i>Amigo Green</i>,&#8221; and as Buck swiftly translated the
few lines in which the writer gave thanks for information
purported to have been given about the middle
pasture and stated that the raid would take place that
night according to arrangement, his lips curled. From
his point of view it seemed incredible that anyone
could be deceived by such a clumsy fraud. But he
was forced to admit that up to a few weeks ago the
girl had never set eyes on him, and knew nothing of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
his antecedents, whereas she trusted Lynch implicitly.
So he refrained from any comment as he handed back
the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t&mdash;deny it?&#8221; asked the girl, an undertone
of disappointment in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; shrugged Stratton. &#8220;You evidently
believe Lynch.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer at once, but stood silent, searching
his face with a troubled, wistful scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know quite what to believe,&#8221; she told him
presently. &#8220;You&mdash;you don&#8217;t seem like a person who
would&mdash;who would&mdash; And yet some one must have
given information.&#8221; Her chin suddenly tilted and her
lips grew firm. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll tell me straight out that
you&#8217;re nothing but an ordinary cow-puncher, that you
have no special object in being here on the ranch, that
you&#8217;re exactly what you seem and nothing more,
then I&mdash;I&#8217;ll believe you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words banished the last part of resentment
lingering in Stratton&#8217;s mind. She was a good sort,
after all. He found himself of a sudden regarding
her with a feeling that was almost tenderness, and
wishing very much that he might tell her everything.
But that, of course, was impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t quite do that,&#8221; he answered slowly.</p>
<p>The hopeful gleam died out of her eyes, and she
made an eloquent, discouraged gesture with both
hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see? What else can I do but let you go?
Unless I take every possible precaution I&#8217;ll be ruined
by these dreadful thieves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck moved his shoulders slightly. &#8220;I understand.
I&#8217;m not kicking. Well, I won&#8217;t keep you any longer.
Thank you very much for telling me what you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abruptly he turned away and in the doorway came
face to face with Alfred Manning, who seemed to
expect the cow-puncher to step obsequiously aside and
let him pass. But Buck was in no humor to step
aside for any one, and for a silent instant their glances
clashed. In the end it was Manning, flushed and looking
daggers, who gave way, and as Stratton passed
the open window a moment later he heard the other&#8217;s
voice raised in an angry pitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly intolerable! I tell you, Mary, you ought
to have that fellow arrested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to do anything of the sort,&#8221; retorted
Miss Thorne.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s your duty. He&#8217;ll get clean away, and
go right on stealing&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Alf!&#8221; There was a tired break in the
girl&#8217;s voice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to talk any more about
it. I&#8217;ve had enough&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton&#8217;s lips tightened and he passed on out of
hearing. The encounter with Manning had irritated
him, and a glimpse of Lynch he caught through the
kitchen door fanned into a fresh glow his smoldering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
anger against the foreman. It was not that he minded
in the least the result of the fellow&#8217;s plotting. But
the method of it, the effrontery of that cowardly, insolent
attempt to blacken and besmirch him with
Mary Thorne, made him more furious each time he
thought of it. When he reached the bunk-house his
rage was white hot.</p>
<p>He found Jessup the sole occupant. It was still
rather early for quitting, and Tex must have set the
other men to doing odd jobs around the barns and
near-by places.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; demanded Bud, as Buck
appeared. &#8220;Tex put me to work oiling harness, but
I sneaked off as soon as he was out of sight. I heard
Slim say yuh were fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flinging his belongings together as he talked,
Stratton briefly retailed the essentials of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to saddle up and start for town right
away,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;If I hang around here much
longer I don&#8217;t know as I can keep my hands off that
double-faced crook.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added some more man-sized adjectives, to which
Bud listened with complete approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh ain&#8217;t said half enough,&#8221; he growled, from
where he stood to the left of the closed door. &#8220;I
wish yuh would stay an&#8217; give him one almighty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
good beating up. He thinks there ain&#8217;t a man on the
range can stand up against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s eyes narrowed. &#8220;I&#8217;d sure like to try,&#8221; he
said regretfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t say I could knock him out,
but I&#8217;d guarantee to give him something to think
about. Trouble is, there&#8217;s nothing gained by starting
a mess like that except letting off steam, and there
might be a whole lot&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly as the door swung open to
admit Lynch and McCabe. The foreman, pausing
just inside the room, eyed Stratton&#8217;s preparations for
departure with curling lips. As a matter of fact,
what he had overheard of the interview between Buck
and Mary Thorne had given him the impression that
Stratton was an easy mark, whose courage and ability
had been greatly overestimated. A more sagacious
person would have been content to let well enough
alone. But Tex had a disposition which impelled him
to rub things in.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s yore dough,&#8221; he said sneeringly, flinging
the little handful of money on the table with such
force that several coins fell to the floor and rolled
into remote corners. &#8220;Yuh better put it away safe,
&#8217;cause after this there ain&#8217;t nobody around these
parts&#8217;ll hire yuh, I&#8217;ll tell a man!&#8221;</p>
<p>His tone was indescribably taunting, and of a sudden
Buck saw red. Dominated by the single-minded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
impulse of primeval man to use the weapons nature gave
him, he forgot momentarily that he carried a gun.
When the two men entered, he had been bending over,
rolling his blankets. Since then, save to raise his
head, he had scarcely altered his position, and yet,
as he poised there motionless, fists clenched, muscles
tense, eyes narrowed to mere slits, Lynch suddenly
realized that he had blundered, and reached swiftly
for his Colt.</p>
<p>But another hand was ahead of his. Standing just
behind him, Bud Jessup had sized up the situation a
fraction of a second before Tex, and like a flash he
bent forward and snatched the foreman&#8217;s weapon
from its holster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut that out, Slim!&#8221; he shrilled, forestalling a
sudden downward jerk of McCabe&#8217;s right hand. &#8220;No
horning in, now. Give it here.&#8221;</p>
<p>An instant later he had slammed the door and shot
the bolt, and stood with back against it, a Colt in each
hand. His freckled face was flushed and his eyes
gleamed with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it, Buck!&#8221; he yelled jubilantly. &#8220;My
money&#8217;s up on yuh, old man. Give him hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynch darted out into the middle of the room,
thrusting aside the table with a single powerful sweep
of one arm. There was no hint of reluctance in his
manner, nor lack of efficiency in the lowering droop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
of his big shoulders or the way his fists fell automatically
into position. His face had hardened into
a fierce mask, out of which savage eyes blazed fearlessly.</p>
<p>An instant later, like the spring of a panther, Stratton&#8217;s
lean, lithe body launched forward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A CHANGE OF BASE</h3>
</div>

<p>Stratton staggered back against the wall and
leaned there, panting. All his strength had gone
out in that last terrific blow, and for a space he seemed
incapable of movement. At length, conscious of a
warm, moist trickle on his chin, he raised one hand
mechanically to his face and brought it away, dabbled
with bright crimson. For a moment or two he regarded
the stiff, crooked fingers and bruised knuckles
in a dazed, impersonal fashion as if the hand belonged
to some one else. Then he became aware that Bud
was speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he mumbled, when the meaning of the reiterated
question penetrated to his consciousness.
&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;all&mdash;right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then his head began to clear, and, slowly straightening
his sagging shoulders, he glanced down at the
hulking figure sprawling motionless amidst the debris
of the wrecked table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;he&mdash;&#8221; he began slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s out, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; stated Jessup crisply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
&#8220;Golly, Buck! That was some punch.&#8221; He paused,
regarding his friend eagerly. &#8220;What are yuh goin&#8217;
to do now?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>A tiny trickle of blood from Stratton&#8217;s cut lip ran
down his chin and splashed on the front of his torn,
disordered shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wash, I reckon,&#8221; he answered, with a twisted
twitch of his stiff lips that was meant to be a smile.
&#8220;I sure need it bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I mean after that,&#8221; explained Bud. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
yuh want me to saddle up while you&#8217;re gettin&#8217; ready?
There ain&#8217;t no point in hangin&#8217; around till he comes
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck took a step or two away from the wall and
regarded the prostrate Lynch briefly, his glance also
taking in McCabe, who bent over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon not,&#8221; he agreed briefly. &#8220;Likewise, if
I don&#8217;t get astride a cayuse mighty soon, I won&#8217;t be
able to climb onto him at all. Go ahead and saddle up,
kid, and I&#8217;ll be with you <i>pronto</i>. You&#8217;d better ride
to town with me and bring back the horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud nodded and, breaking the Colts one after
another, pocketed the shells and dropped the weapons
into a near-by bunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh needn&#8217;t bother to do that,&#8221; commented McCabe
sourly. &#8220;Nobody ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to drill no holes
in yuh; we&#8217;re only too tickled to see yuh get out. If
you&#8217;re wise, kid, you&#8217;ll stay away, likewise. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
wouldn&#8217;t be in yore shoes for no money when Tex
comes around an&#8217; remembers what yuh done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I can take care of m&#8217;self,&#8221; retorted
Jessup. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t Tex&#8217;s game to be took up for no
murder yet awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further comment he gathered up most of
Stratton&#8217;s belongings and departed for the corral.
Buck took his hand-bag and, leaving the cabin, limped
slowly down to the creek. He was surprised to note
that the encounter seemed to have attracted no attention
up at the ranch-house. Then he realized that
with the door and windows closed, what little noise
there had been might well have passed unnoticed,
especially as the men were at work back in the barns.</p>
<p>At the creek he washed the blood from his face and
hands, changed his shirt, put a strip of plaster on his
cut lip, and decided that any further repairs could
wait until he reached Paloma.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the corral Bud had just finished
saddling the second horse, and they lost no time
making fast Buck&#8217;s belongings. The animals were
then led out, and Stratton was on the point of mounting
when the sound of light footsteps made him turn
quickly to find Miss Manning almost at his elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not leaving now, without waiting to
say good-by?&#8221; she expostulated.</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s lips straightened grimly, with a grotesque
twisted effect caused by the plaster at the corner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After what&#8217;s happened I hardly supposed anybody&#8217;d
want any farewell words,&#8221; he commented with
a touch of sarcasm.</p>
<p>Miss Manning stamped her shapely, well-shod foot
petulantly. &#8220;Rubbish!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
suppose I believe that nonsense, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re about the only one who doesn&#8217;t,
then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. Mrs. Archer agrees with me. She says
you couldn&#8217;t be a&mdash;a thief if you tried. And down
in her heart even Mary&mdash; But whatever has happened
to your face?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton flushed faintly. &#8220;Oh, I just&mdash;cut myself
against something,&#8221; he shrugged. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing
serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; she commented, dimpling a
little. &#8220;It certainly doesn&#8217;t add to your beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was bare-headed, and the slanting sunlight,
caressing the crisp waves of hair, revealed an unsuspected
reddish glint amongst the dark tresses. As he
looked down into her clear, friendly eyes, Buck realized,
and not the first time, how very attractive she
really was. If things had only been different, if only
the barrier of that hateful mental lapse of his had not
existed, he had a feeling that they might have been
very good friends indeed.</p>
<p>His lips had parted for a farewell word or two when
suddenly he caught the flutter of skirts over by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
corner of the ranch-house. It was Mary Thorne, and
Buck wondered with an odd, unexpected little thrill,
whether by any chance she too might be coming to say
good-by. Whatever may have been her intention,
however, it changed abruptly. Catching sight of the
group beside the corral fence, she stopped short,
hesitated an instant, and then, turning square about,
disappeared in the direction she had come. As he
glanced back to Stella Manning, Buck&#8217;s face was a
little clouded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to be getting started, I reckon,&#8221; he
said briefly. &#8220;Thank you very much for&mdash;for seeing
me off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paloma for to-night; after that I&#8217;ll be hunting
another job.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl put out her hand and Stratton took it,
hoping that she wouldn&#8217;t notice his raw, bruised
knuckles. He might have spared himself the momentary
anxiety. She wasn&#8217;t looking at his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s good-by, then,&#8221; she said, a note of regret
underlying the surface brightness of her tone. &#8220;But
when you&#8217;re settled you must send me a line. We
were such good pals aboard ship, and I haven&#8217;t
enough friends to want to lose even one of them.
Send a letter here to the ranch, and if we&#8217;re gone,
Mary will forward it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>Buck promised, and swung himself stiffly into the
saddle. As he and Bud rode briskly down the slope,
he turned and glanced back for an instant. Miss
Manning stood where they had left her, handkerchief
fluttering from her upraised hand, but Stratton
scarcely saw her. His gaze swept the front of the
ranch-house, scrutinizing each gaping, empty window
and the deserted porch. Finally, with a faint sigh and
a little shrug of his shoulders, he mentally dismissed
the past and fell to considering the future.</p>
<p>There was a good deal yet to be talked over and
decided, and when he had briefly detailed to Bud the
various happenings he was still ignorant of, Buck
went on to outline his plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several things I want to look into, and
to do it I&#8217;ve got to be on the loose,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;At the same time I don&#8217;t want Lynch to get the idea
I&#8217;m snooping around. What sort of a fellow is
this Tenny, over at the Rocking-R?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s white,&#8221; returned Bud promptly. &#8220;No
squarer ranch-boss around the country. I&#8217;d of gone
there instead of the Shoe-Bar, only they was full up.
What was yuh thinkin&#8217; of&mdash;bracin&#8217; him for a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly, though I&#8217;d like Lynch to think I&#8217;d
been taken on there. Do you suppose, if I put Tenny
wise to what I was after, that he&#8217;d let me have a
cayuse and pack-horse, and stake me to enough grub
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
to keep me a week or two in the mountains back of
the Shoe-Bar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might, especially when he knows you&#8217;re buckin&#8217;
Tex; he never was much in love with Lynch.&#8221; Jessup
paused, eyeing his companion curiously. &#8220;Say, Buck,&#8221;
he went on quickly, &#8220;What makes yuh so keen about
this, anyhow? Yuh ain&#8217;t no deputy sheriff, or anythin&#8217;
like that, are yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Stratton was taken aback by the
unexpectedness of the question. He had come to regard
Jessup and himself so completely at one in their
desire to penetrate the mystery of Lynch&#8217;s shady doings
that it had never occurred to him that his intense
absorption in the situation might strike Bud as
peculiar. It was one thing to behave as Bud was
doing, especially as he frankly had the interest of Mary
Thorne at heart, and quite another to throw up a job
and plan to carry on an unproductive investigation
from a theoretical desire to bring to justice a crooked
foreman whom he had never seen until a few weeks
ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course not,&#8221; parried Buck. &#8220;What gave
you that notion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno exactly. I s&#8217;pose mebbe it&#8217;s the way
you&#8217;re plannin&#8217; to give yore time to it without pay or
nothin&#8217;. There won&#8217;t be a darn cent in it for yuh,
even if yuh do land Tex in the pen.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; and Buck smiled; &#8220;but I&#8217;m a stubborn
cuss when I get started on anything. Besides, I
love Tex Lynch well enough to want to see him get
every mite that&#8217;s comin&#8217; to him. I&#8217;ve got a little
money saved up, and I&#8217;ll get more fun spending it this
way than any other I can think of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; in that,&#8221; agreed Jessup. &#8220;Golly,
Buck! I wisht I could go along with yuh. I never
was much on savin&#8217;, but I could manage a couple of
weeks without a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton hesitated. &#8220;I&#8217;d sure like it, kid,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;It would be a whole lot pleasanter for
me, but I&#8217;m wondering if you wouldn&#8217;t do more good
there on the Shoe-Bar. With nobody at all to cross
him, there&#8217;s no tellin&#8217; what Lynch might try and pull
off. Besides, it seems to me somebody ought to be
there to sort of look after Miss&mdash;&#8221; He broke off,
struck by a sudden possibility. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose
he&#8217;ll get really nasty about what you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; broke in Bud sharply. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking
about that. He&#8217;ll be nasty, of course, but he can&#8217;t
go more than so far. I reckon you&#8217;re right,
Buck. Miss Mary oughtn&#8217;t to be left there by herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, there&#8217;s Manning&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud disposed of the aristocratic Alfred with a forceable
epithet which ought to have made his ears burn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
&#8220;Besides, that bird ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to stay forever, I hope,&#8221;
he added.</p>
<p>This settled, they passed on to other details, and by
the time they reached Paloma, everything had been
threshed out and decided, including a possible means
of communication in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Ravenously hungry, they sought the ramshackle
hotel at once, and though it was long after the regular
supper hour, they succeeded in getting a fair meal
cooked and served. Concluding that it would
be pleasanter all around to give Lynch as much time
as possible to recover from his spleen, Bud decided to
defer his return to the ranch until early morning. So
when they had finished eating, they walked down to
the store to arrange for hiring one of Daggett&#8217;s horses
again. Here they were forced to spend half an hour
listening to old Pop&#8217;s garrulous comments and the repeated
&#8220;I told you so,&#8221; which greeted the news of Stratton&#8217;s
move before they could tear themselves away
and turn in.</p>
<p>They were up at dawn, ate a hurried breakfast, and
then set out along the trail. Where the Rocking-R
track branched off they paused for a few casual words
of farewell, and then each went his way. A few
hundred yards beyond, Buck turned in his saddle just
in time to see Jessup, leading Stratton&#8217;s old mount,
ride briskly into a shallow draw and disappear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>He had a feeling that he was going to miss the
youngster, with his cheerful optimism and dependable
ways; but he felt that at the most a few weeks would
see them together again. Fortunately for his peace of
mind, he had not the least suspicion of the circumstances
which were to bring about their next meeting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS MOTOR-CAR</h3>
</div>

<p>Buck took to Jim Tenny at once. There was
something about this long, lean, brown-faced
foreman of the Rocking-R, with his clear gray eyes
and that half-humorous twist to his thin lips, which inspired
not only confidence but liking as well. He listened
without comment to Buck&#8217;s story, which included
practically everything save the revelation of his own
identity; but once or twice, especially at the brief
mention of the fight in the bunk-house, his eyes
gleamed with momentary approval. When Buck told
about the blackleg incident his face darkened and he
spoke for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like yuh had him there,&#8221; he said briefly.
&#8220;That job alone ought to land him in the pen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck nodded. &#8220;I know; but I&#8217;m afraid he couldn&#8217;t
be convicted on my evidence alone. Kreeger and
Siegrist fixed up a pretty decent alibi, you see, and it
would only be my word against theirs. Even the
carcass of the beast wouldn&#8217;t help much. They&#8217;d
say it wandered through the pass by itself, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
suppose there&#8217;s one chance in a thousand it could
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damned unlikely, though,&#8221; shrugged Tenny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure; but the law&#8217;s that way. You&#8217;ve got to be
dead certain. Besides, if he was pulled in for that
we might never find out just what&#8217;s at the bottom
of it all. That&#8217;s the important thing, and if I can
only get a line on what he&#8217;s up to, we&#8217;ll land him
swift enough, believe me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Warned by Bud&#8217;s unexpected question the evening
before that he must have a more plausible motive for
following up the case, Buck had coolly appointed himself
one of Jim Hardenberg&#8217;s deputies. He hinted
that rumors of the cattle-stealing had reached the
sheriff, who, debarred from taking up the matter
openly by the absence of any complaint from the owner
of the Shoe-Bar, had dispatched Stratton on a secret
investigation. The process of that investigation having
disclosed evidences of rascality of which the
rustling was but a minor feature, Stratton&#8217;s desire
to probe the mystery to the bottom seemed perfectly
natural, and the need for secrecy was also accounted
for. The only risk Buck ran was of Tenny&#8217;s mentioning
the matter to Hardenberg himself, and that seemed
slight enough. At the worst it would merely mean
anticipating a little; for if he did succeed in solving
the problem of Tex Lynch&#8217;s motives, the next and
final step would naturally be up to the sheriff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I get yuh,&#8221; said Tenny, nodding. &#8220;That&#8217;s true
enough. Well, what do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck told him briefly, and the foreman&#8217;s eyes
twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some order,&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d pay you for the stock and grub, of course,&#8221;
Stratton assured him; &#8220;and at least put up a deposit
for the cayuses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that part ain&#8217;t frettin&#8217; me none. I reckon I
can trust yuh. I was thinkin&#8217; about how I could stall
off Lynch in case he comes around askin&#8217; questions.
Yuh want he should get the idea I hired yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it would ease his mind and give him the
notion I was safe for a while,&#8221; smiled Stratton. &#8220;Of
course you could say I tried for a job but you were
full up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be easier,&#8221; agreed Tenny. &#8220;I could
keep my mouth shut, but I couldn&#8217;t guarantee about
the boys. They wouldn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; a-purpose, but
like as not if they should meet up with one of that
slick crowd at the Shoe-Bar they&#8217;d let somethin&#8217; slip
without thinkin&#8217;. On the other hand, it sure would
make him a mite careless if he thought yuh was tied
down here on a reg&#8217;lar job.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused reflectively; then suddenly his eyes
brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got it,&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you down to
help Gabby Smith at Red Butte camp. That&#8217;s &#8217;way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
to hell and gone down at the south end of the outfit,
where nobody goes from here more&#8217;n about once in
six months. Gabby&#8217;s one of these here solitary guys
that&#8217;s sorta soured on the world in gen&#8217;al, an&#8217; don&#8217;t
hardly open his face except to take in grub, but yuh
can trust him. Jest tell him what yuh want and
he&#8217;ll do it, providin&#8217; yuh don&#8217;t hang around the camp
too long. Gabby does hate company worse&#8217;n a dose
of poison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tenny lost no time in carrying out his plans.
He hunted out a few simple cooking-utensils and
enough canned goods and other stores to last two
weeks, picked a pack-animal and a riding horse, and
by dinner-time had everything ready for Buck to start
immediately afterward.</p>
<p>The six or seven cow-punchers who responded to
the gong presented a marked and pleasant contrast
to the Shoe-Bar outfit. They greeted Stratton with
some brevity, but after the first pangs of hunger had
been assuaged and they learned where he was bound
for, they expanded, and Buck was the object of much
joking commiseration on the prospect before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll sure have one wild time,&#8221; grinned a dark-haired,
blue-eyed youngster called Broncho. &#8220;Gabby&#8217;s
about as sociable as a rattler. I wouldn&#8217;t change
places with yuh for no money.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one seemed to suspect any ulterior motive beneath
the plan, and when Buck rode off about one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
o&#8217;clock, leading his pack-horse, his spirits rose insensibly
at the ease with which things seemed to be
working out.</p>
<p>He reached Red Butte camp in a little more than
three hours and found the adobe shack deserted. It
was similar in size and construction to Las Vegas,
but there all likeness ceased, for the interior was surprisingly
comfortable and as spick-and-span as the
Shoe-Bar line camp was cluttered and dirty. Everything
was so immaculate, in fact, that Buck had a
moment of hesitation about flicking his cigarette ashes
on the floor, and banished his scruples mainly because
he had never heard of a cow-man dropping them anywhere
else.</p>
<p>Gabby appeared about an hour later, a tall, stooping
man of uncertain middle age, with a cold eye and a
perpetual, sour droop to his lids. At the sight of
Buck the sourness became accentuated and increased
still more when he observed the ashes on the floor.
His only reply to Stratton&#8217;s introduction of himself
was a grunt and Buck lost no time in easing the
fellow&#8217;s mind of any fear of a prolonged spell of company.</p>
<p>Even then Gabby&#8217;s gloom scarcely lightened. He
listened, however, to Stratton&#8217;s brief explanation and
in a few gruff words agreed that in the unlikely event
of any inquiry he would say that the new hand was
off riding fence or something of the sort. Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
swept out the offending ashes and proceeded methodically
to get supper, declining any assistance from his
visitor.</p>
<p>His manner was so dispiriting that Buck was thankful
when the silent meal was over, and even more so
an hour later to spread his blankets in one of the spare
bunks and turn in. His relief at getting away early
the next morning was almost as great as Gabby&#8217;s could
be to see him go.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon, after a careful circuit
of the southern end of the Shoe-Bar, that Buck reached
the foothills. Bud had told him of a spring to the
northwest of Las Vegas camp, but the rough traveling
decided him to camp that night on the further side of
the creek. In the morning he went on through a
wilderness of arroyos, cañons, and gullies that twisted
endlessly between the barren hills, and made him
realize how simple it would be for any number of men
and cattle to evade pursuit in this wild country.</p>
<p>Fortunately Jessup&#8217;s directions had been explicit,
and toward noon Buck found the spring at the bottom
of a small cañon and proceeded to unpack and settle
down. Bud himself had discovered the place by
accident, and as far as Stratton could judge it was
not a likely spot to be visited either by the Shoe-Bar
hands or their Mexican confederates. A wide, overhanging
ledge provided shelter for himself, and there
was plenty of forage in sight for the two horses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
Taken all in all, it was as snug a retreat as any one
could wish, and Buck congratulated himself on having
such safe and secluded headquarters from which to
carry on his investigations.</p>
<p>These first took him southward, and for five days he
rode through the hills, traversing gullies and cañons,
and spying out the whole country generally, in a
systematic effort to find the route taken by the rustlers
in driving off their booty.</p>
<p>Once he found the spot where they had taken to
the hills, the rest was comparatively simple. There
were a number of signs to guide him, including the
bodies of two animals bearing the familiar brand,
and he succeeded in tracing the thieves to a point on
the edge of a stretch of desert twenty miles or more
below the Shoe-Bar land. About twelve miles beyond
lay another range of hills, which would give them
cover until they were within a short distance of the
border.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dozen good fellows stationed here,&#8221; thought
Stratton, critically surveying the gully behind him,
&#8220;would catch them without any trouble. There&#8217;s no
other way I&#8217;ve seen of getting out with a bunch of
cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having settled this point to his satisfaction, Buck&#8217;s
mind veered swiftly&mdash;with an odd sense of relief that
now at last he could investigate the matter seriously&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
the other problem which had stirred his curiosity
so long.</p>
<p>When his attention was first attracted to the north
pasture by Bud&#8217;s account of Andrew Thorne&#8217;s tragic
death, its connection with the mystery of the ranch
seemed trivial. But for some reason the thing stuck
in his mind, returning again and again with a teasing
persistence and gaining each time in significance.
From much thinking about it, Buck could almost reconstruct
the scene, with its familiar, humdrum background
of bawling calves, lowing mothers, dust, hot
irons, swearing, sweating men, and all the other
accompaniments of the spring branding. That was
the picture into which Thorne had suddenly ridden,
his face stamped with an excitement in marked contrast
to his usual phlegmatic calm. In his mind&#8217;s eye
Stratton could see him clutch Tex Lynch and draw
him hastily to one side, could imagine vividly the low-voiced
conversation that followed, the hurried
saddling of a fresh horse, and the swift departure
of the two northward&mdash;to what?</p>
<p>Buck had asked himself that question a hundred
times. Three hours had passed before the return
of Lynch alone, with the shocking news&mdash;time enough
to ride twice the distance to north pasture and back
again. Where had the interval been passed, and
how?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>Stratton realized that they might easily have
changed their direction, once they were out of sight
of the men. They might have gone eastward toward
the ranch-house&mdash;which they had not&mdash;or westward
into the mountains. Once or twice Buck considered
the possibility of the old man&#8217;s having stumbled on a
rich lode of precious metal. But as far as he knew
no trace of gold had ever been found in these mountains.
Moreover, though Lynch was perfectly capable
of murdering his employer for that knowledge, his
next logical move would have been an immediate taking
up of the claims, instead of which he remained
quietly on the ranch to carry on his slow and secret
plotting.</p>
<p>Stratton long ago dismissed that possibility. There
remained only the north pasture, and the longer he
considered it the more he became convinced that Thorne
had met his death there, and that the chances were
strong that somewhere in those wastes of worthless
desert land lay the key to the whole enthralling
mystery.</p>
<p>Buck was so eager to start his investigations that it
irked him to have to spend the few remaining hours
of the afternoon in idleness. But as he knew that the
undertaking would take a full day or even longer, he
possessed his soul with patience and made arrangements
for an early start next morning.</p>
<p>The dawn was just breaking when he left camp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
mounted on Pete, the Rocking-R horse that he had
found so reliable in the rough country. The simplest
and most direct way would have been to descend to
level ground and ride along the edge of the Shoe-Bar
land. But he dared not take any chances of being observed
by Lynch or his gang, and was forced to make
a long detour through the hills.</p>
<p>The way was difficult and roundabout. Frequently
he was turned back by blind cañons or gullies which
had no outlet, and there were few places where the
horse could go faster than a walk. To Buck&#8217;s impatient
spirit it was all tiresome and exasperating, and
he had moments of wondering whether he was ever
going to get anywhere.</p>
<p>Finally, about the middle of the afternoon, he was
cheered for the first time by an unexpected glimpse
of his goal. For several miles he had been following
a rough trail which wound around the side of a
steep, irregular hill. Coming out abruptly on a little
plateau, with the tumbled rocks rising at his back,
there spread out suddenly before him to the east a wide,
extended sweep of level country.</p>
<p>At first he could scarcely believe that the sandy
stretch below him was the north pasture he was seeking.
But swiftly he realized that the threadlike line
a little to the south must be the fence dividing the
desert from the fertile portions of the Shoe-Bar, and
he even thought he recognized the corner where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
infected steer had been driven through. With an exclamation
of satisfaction he was reaching for his field-glasses
when of a sudden a strange, slowly-moving
shape out in the desert caught his attention and riveted
it instantly.</p>
<p>For a few seconds Buck thought his eyes were
playing tricks. Amazed, incredulous, forgetting for
an instant the field-glasses in his hand, he stared
blankly from under squinting lids at the incredible
object that crawled lurchingly through the shimmering,
glittering desert atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dotty!&#8221; he muttered at length. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, remembering the glasses, he raised them hastily
to his eyes and focused them with a twist or two
of practised fingers.</p>
<p>He was neither crazy nor mistaken. Drawn suddenly
out of its blurred obscurity by the powerful
lenses, there sprang up before Buck&#8217;s eyes, sharp and
clear in every detail, a big gray motor-car that moved
slowly but steadily, with many a bump and sidewise
lurch, diagonally across the cactus-sprinkled desert below
him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>CATASTROPHE</h3>
</div>

<p>The discovery galvanized Stratton into instant,
alert attention. Motor-cars were rare in this
remote range country and confined almost solely to
the sort of &#8220;flivver&#8221; which is not entirely dependent on
roads. The presence in the north pasture of this
powerful gray machine, which certainly did not belong
in the neighborhood, was more than significant, and
Buck tried at once to get a view of the occupants.</p>
<p>In this he was not successful. There were three
of them, one in the driver&#8217;s seat and two others in
the tonneau. But the top prevented more than a
glimpse of the latter, while the cap and goggles of
the chauffeur left visible only a wedge of brick-red,
dust-coated skin, a thin, prominent nose and a wisp
of wiry black mustache.</p>
<p>One thing was certain&mdash;the fellow knew his job.
Under his masterly guidance the big car plowed steadily
through the clogging sand, avoiding obstructions
or surmounting them with the least possible expenditure
of power, never once stalled, and, except for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
necessary slight divergence now and then, held closely
to its northwesterly course across the desert.</p>
<p>Buck, who had driven under the worst possible
battle-front conditions, fully appreciated the coaxing,
the general man&oelig;uvering, the constant delicate
manipulation of brake and throttle necessary to produce
this result. But his admiration of the fellow&#8217;s
skill was swiftly swallowed up in eager curiosity and
speculation.</p>
<p>Who were they? What were they doing here?
Where were they going? At first he had a momentary
fear lest they should see him perched up here on his
point of vantage. Then he realized that the backing
of rocks prevented his figure from showing against
the skyline, which, together with the distance and the
clouds of dust stirred up by the car itself, made the
danger almost negligible. So he merely dismounted
and, leaning against his horse, kept the glasses riveted
on the slowly moving machine.</p>
<p>The car advanced steadily until it reached a point
about a quarter of a mile from the rough ground and
a little distance north of where Buck stood. Then
it stopped, and a capped and goggled head was thrust
out of the tonneau. Buck could make out nothing
definite about the face save that it was smooth-shaven
and rather heavy-jowled. He was hoping that the
fellow would alight from the car and show himself
more plainly but to his disappointment the head was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
presently drawn back and the machine crept on, swerving
a little so that it headed almost due north.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later it halted again, and this time the
two men got out and walked slowly over the sand.
Both were clad in long dust-coats, and one seemed
stouter and heavier than the other. Unfortunately
they were too far beyond the carrying power of the
binoculars to get anything more clearly, and Buck
swore and fretted and strained his eyes in vain. After
a delay of nearly an hour, he saw the car start again,
and followed its blurred image until it finally disappeared
beyond an out-thrust spur well to the northward.</p>
<p>Stratton lowered his glasses and stood for a moment
or two rubbing his cramped arm absently. His face
was thoughtful, with a glint of excitement in his eyes.
Presently his shoulders straightened resolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I can follow the tracks of the tires and
find out what they&#8217;ve been up to,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>The difficulty was to descend from his rocky perch,
and it proved to be no small one. He might have
clambered down the face of the cliff, but that would
mean abandoning his horse. In the end he was forced
to retrace his steps along the twisting ledge by which
he had come.</p>
<p>From his knowledge of the country to the south,
Buck had started out with the idea that it would be
simple enough to reach the flats through one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
many gullies and cañons that fringed the margin of
the hills further down. He had not counted on the
fact that as the range widened it split into two distinct
ridges, steep and declivitous on the outer edges,
with the space between them broken up into a network
of water-worn gullies and arroyos.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to have known from the look of the north
pasture that all the water goes the other way,&#8221; he
grumbled. &#8220;Best thing I can do is to head for that
trail Bud spoke of that cuts through to the T-T ranch.
It can&#8217;t be so very far north.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t, as the crow flies, but Buck was no
aviator. He was forced to take a most tortuous,
roundabout route, and when he finally emerged on the
first passable track heading approximately in the right
direction, the sun was low and there seemed little
chance of his accomplishing his purpose in the few
hours of daylight remaining.</p>
<p>Still, he kept on. At least he was mapping out a
route which would be easily and swiftly followed another
time. And if darkness threatened, he could
return to his little camp through the open Shoe-Bar
pastures, where neither Lynch nor his men were at all
likely to linger after dusk.</p>
<p>The trail followed a natural break in the hills and,
though not especially difficult under foot, was twisting
and irregular, full of sharp descents and equally
steep upward slopes. Buck had covered about two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
miles and was growing impatient when he came to
the hardest climb he had yet encountered and swung
himself out of the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use killing you, Pete, to save a little time,&#8221;
he commented, giving the horse&#8217;s sweaty neck a slap.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know how the devil those two ever drove
a steer through here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did seem as if this must have been uncommonly
difficult. The trail curved steeply around the side
of a hill, following a ledge similar to the one Buck
had taken earlier in the afternoon with such interesting
results. There was width enough for safety, but
on one side the rocks rose sharply to the summit of
the hill, while on the other there was a sheer drop into
a gulch below, which, at the crown of the slope, must
have been fifty or sixty feet at least.</p>
<p>Leading the horse, Buck plodded on in a rather discouraged
fashion until he had covered about three-quarters
of the distance to the top. Then of a sudden
his pace quickened, as a bend in the trail revealed
hopeful glimpses of open spaces ahead. It was nothing
really definite&mdash;merely a falling away of the hills
on either side and a wide expanse of unobstructed sky
beyond, but it made him feel that he was at last coming
out of this rocky wilderness. A moment or two
later he gained the summit of the slope and his eyes
brightened as they rested on the section of sandy,
cactus-dotted country spread out below him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>A dozen feet ahead the trail curved sharply around
a rocky buttress, which hid the remainder of it from
view. In his eagerness to see what lay beyond, Stratton
did not mount but led his horse over the short
stretch of level rock. But as he turned the corner,
he caught his breath and jerked back on Pete&#8217;s reins.</p>
<p>By one of those freaks of nature that are often so
surprising, the trail led straight down to level ground
with almost the regularity of some work of engineering.
At the foot of it stood the gray motor-car&mdash;empty!</p>
<p>The sight of it, and especially that unnatural air
of complete desertion, instantly aroused in Buck a
sense of acute danger. He turned swiftly to retreat,
and caught a glimpse of a figure crouching in a little
rocky niche almost at his elbow.</p>
<p>There was no time to leap back or forward; no time
even to stir. Already the man&#8217;s arm was lifted, and
though Stratton&#8217;s hand jerked automatically to his
gun, he was too late.</p>
<p>An instant later something struck his head with
crushing force and crumpled him to the ground.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Buck began to struggle out of that black,
bottomless abyss of complete oblivion, he thought at
first&mdash;as soon as he could think at all&mdash;that he was
lying in his bunk back at the Shoe-Bar. What gave
him the idea he could not tell. His head throbbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
painfully, and his brain seemed to swim in a vague, uncertain
mist. A deadly lassitude gripped him, making
all movement, even to the lifting of his eyelids, an
exertion too great to be considered.</p>
<p>But presently, when his brain had cleared a little,
he became aware of voices. One in particular seemed,
even in his dreamlike state, to sting into his consciousness
with a peculiar, bitter instinct of hatred. When
at length he realized that it was the voice of Tex
Lynch, the discovery had a curiously reviving effect
upon his dazed senses. He could not yet remember
what had happened, but intuitively he associated his
helplessness with the foreman&#8217;s presence, and that
same instinct caused him to make a desperate attempt
to understand what the man was saying. At first the
fellow&#8217;s words seemed blurred and broken, but little
by little their meaning grew clearer to the injured
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;... ain&#8217;t safe ... suspects somethin&#8217; ...
snoopin&#8217; around ever since ... thought he was up to
somethin&#8217; ... saw him up on that ledge watchin&#8217; yuh
... dead sure. I had a notion he&#8217;d ride around
to this trail, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s the only way down to north
pasture. I tell yuh, Paul, he&#8217;s wise, an&#8217; he&#8217;ll spill
the beans sure. We got to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it, I tell you!&#8221; protested a shrill, high-pitched
voice querulously. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, all yuh got to do is go back to the car an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
wait,&#8221; retorted Lynch. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t so partic&#8217;lar. Besides,&#8221;
his tone changed subtly, &#8220;his head&#8217;s smashed
in an&#8217; he&#8217;s sure to croak, anyhow. It would be an
act of kindness, yuh might say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; came again in the shrill voice.
&#8220;I&#8217;d&mdash;hear the shot. I&#8217;d know what you were doing.
It would be on my&mdash;my conscience. I&#8217;d dream&mdash; If
he&#8217;s going to&mdash;to die, as you say, why not just&mdash;leave
him here?&#8221;</p>
<p>An involuntary shudder passed over Stratton. It
had all come back, and with a thrill of horror he
realized that they were talking about him. They were
discussing his fate as calmly and callously as if he
had been a steer with a broken leg. A feeble protest
trembled on his lips, but was choked back unuttered.
He knew how futile any protest would be with Tex
Lynch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221; the latter snarled. &#8220;An&#8217; have somebody
come along an&#8217; find him! Like as not he&#8217;d hang on
long enough to blab all he knows, an&#8217; then where
would we be? Where would we be even if somebody
run acrost his body? I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; no chances like
that, I&#8217;ll tell the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t there some other way?&#8221; faltered the high-pitched
voice.</p>
<p>In the brief pause that followed, Stratton dragged
his lids open. He was lying where he had fallen at
the curve in the trail. Tex Lynch stood close beside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
him. A little beyond, leaning against the rocky cliff,
was a bulky figure in a long dust-coat. He had
pushed up his motor-goggles and was wiping his forehead
with a limp handkerchief. His round, fat face,
with pursed-up lips and wide-open light-blue eyes,
bore the expression of a fretful child. On his left was
a lean, thin-faced fellow with a black mustache who
looked scared and nervous. There was no sign of the
third person who had been in the car, and even at this
crucial moment Buck found time to observe the absence
of his horse, Pete, and wondered momentarily what
had become of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh an&#8217; Hurd go back to the car.&#8221; Lynch broke
the silence in a tone of sudden decision. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tend
to this business, an&#8217; there won&#8217;t be no shootin&#8217; neither.
Hustle, now! We ain&#8217;t got any time to lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Buck shuddered, and there pulsed through
him that tremendous and passionate instinct for self-preservation
which comes to every man at such a time.
What Tex meant to do he could not guess, but he
knew that if he were left alone with the fellow he
might as well give up all hope. He was weak as a
cat, and felt sure that no appeal from him would move
Lynch a particle. His only chance lay with the fat
man and his companion, and as the two turned away,
Buck tried his best to call out after them.</p>
<p>The only result was an inarticulate croak. Lynch
heard it, and instantly dropping on his knees, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
clapped one hand over Stratton&#8217;s mouth. In spite of
Buck&#8217;s futile struggles, he held it there firmly while
the two men moved out of sight down the trail. His
face, which still bore the fading marks of Buck&#8217;s fists,
was a trifle pale, but hard and determined, and in his
eyes triumph and a curious, nervous shrinking struggled
for mastery.</p>
<p>But as the moments dragged on leaden wings, not
a word passed his tight lips. Presently he glanced
swiftly over one shoulder. An instant later Buck&#8217;s
lips were freed, and he felt the foreman&#8217;s hands slipping
under his body.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hellion!&#8221; he gasped, as Lynch&#8217;s purpose
flashed on him in all its horror. &#8220;You damned cowardly
hound!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he felt himself thrust helplessly toward the precipice,
Buck made a tremendous, despairing effort and
managed to catch Lynch by the belt and clung there for
a moment. When one hand was torn loose, he even
struck Tex wildly in the face. But there was no
strength in his arm, and Lynch, with a growl of rage,
jerked himself free and sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>For an instant he towered over his helpless enemy,
white-faced and hesitating. Then Stratton caught
the hard impact of his boot against his side, and felt
the edge of the rock slipping horribly beneath him.
Powerless to help himself, his clutching fingers slid
despairingly across the smooth surface. A blinding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
ray of sunlight dazzled him for an instant and vanished;
the mountain trail flashed out of sight. His
heart leaped, then sank, with a tremendous, poignant
agony that seemed to tear him into shreds. Then
blackness seemed to rush out of the gulch to enfold him
in an impenetrable cloud of merciful oblivion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>WHAT MARY THORNE FOUND</h3>
</div>

<p>A few hundred yards away from the fence strung
along the western side of middle pasture, Mary
Thorne pulled her horse down to a walk and straightened
her hat mechanically. Her cheeks were flushed
becomingly and her eyes shone, but at the end of that
sharp little canter much of the brightness faded and
her face clouded.</p>
<p>For the last week or more it had grown increasingly
difficult to keep up a cheerful front and prevent the
doubts and troubles which harassed her from causing
comment. This morning she had reached the limit
of suppression. Stella got on her nerves more than
usual; Alf annoyed her with his superior air and those
frequent little intimate mannerisms which, though unnoticed
during all the years of their friendship, had
lately grown curiously irksome to the girl. Even
Mrs. Archer&#8217;s calm placidity weighed on her spirits,
and when that happened Mary knew that it was high
time for her to get away by herself for a few hours
and make a vigorous effort to recover her wonted
serenity of mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>She told herself that she was tired and jaded, and
that a solitary ride would soothe her ragged nerves.
And so, at the first opportunity after breakfast, she
slipped quietly away, saddled her favorite horse,
Freckles, and leaving word with Pedro that she would
be back by dinner-time, departed hastily.</p>
<p>It was rather curious behavior in a girl usually so
frank and open, and free from even a suspicion of
guile, but she deliberately gave the Mexican an impression
that she was going to join the men down
in south pasture, and as long as she remained within
sight of the ranch-house she kept her horse headed in
that direction. Furthermore, before abruptly changing
her course to the northwest, she pulled up and
glanced sharply around to make certain she was not
observed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact one of the things which had
lately puzzled and troubled her was a growing impression
of surveillance. Several times she had surprised
Pedro or his wife in attitudes which seemed
suspiciously as if they had been spying. McCabe,
too, and some of the other men were inclined to pop up
when she least expected them. Indeed, looking back
on the last two weeks she realized how very little she
had been alone except in the close confines of the
ranch-house. If she rode forth to inspect the work or
merely to take a little canter, Tex or one of the punchers
was almost sure to join her. They always had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
a good excuse, but equally always they were there;
and though Mary Thorne had not the remotest notion
of the meaning of it all, she had grown convinced
that there must be some hidden motive beneath their
actions, and the thought troubled her.</p>
<p>Tex Lynch&#8217;s altered manner gave her even greater
cause for anxiety. It would have been difficult to put
into words exactly where the change lay, but she was
sure that there was a difference. Up to a short time
ago she had regarded him impersonally as merely an
efficient foreman whom she had inherited from her
father along with the ranch. She did so still, but she
could not remain blind to the fact that the man himself
was deliberately striving to inject a more intimate
note into their intercourse. His methods were subtle
enough, but Mary Thorne was far from dull, and
the alteration in his manner made her at once indignant
and a little frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s silly to feel that way, especially with
Alf here,&#8221; she murmured as she reached the fence and
swung herself out of the saddle. &#8220;But I do wish I
hadn&#8217;t taken his word about&mdash;Buck Green.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took a small pair of pliers from her saddle-pocket
and deftly untwisted the strands of wire from
one of the posts, while Freckles looked on with an
expression of intelligent interest. When the gap was
opened in the fence, he walked through and waited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
quietly on the other side until the wire had been replaced.
It was not the first time he had done this
trick, for the trail through the mountains was a favorite
retreat of the girl&#8217;s. She had discovered it long
ago, and returned to it frequently, through her own
private break in the fence, especially on occasions like
this when she wanted to get away from everybody and
be quite alone.</p>
<p>Having remounted and headed northward along the
edge of the hills, her thoughts flashed back to the discharged
cow-puncher, and her brow puckered. The
whole subject affected her in a curiously complicated
fashion. From the first she had been conscious of
having done the young man an injustice. And yet, as
often as she went over their final interview in her mind&mdash;which
was not seldom&mdash;she did not see how she
could have done otherwise. Her woman&#8217;s intuition
told her over and over again that he could not possibly
be a common thief; but if this was so, why
had he refused her the simple assurance she asked
for?</p>
<p>That was the stumbling-block. If he had only been
frank and open, she felt that she would have believed
him, even in the face of Lynch&#8217;s conviction of his
guilt, though she was frank enough to admit that the
foreman&#8217;s attitude would probably have influenced her
much more strongly a week ago than it did at present.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
It was this thought which brought her mind around
to another of her worries.</p>
<p>Not only did she intensely dislike Lynch&#8217;s present
manner toward herself, but there had lately grown up
in her mind a vague distrust of the man generally.
She could not put her finger on anything really definite.
There were moments, indeed, when she wondered if
she was not a silly little fool making bogies out of
shadows. But the feeling persisted, growing on
unconsidered trifles, that Tex was playing at some
subtle, secret game, of the character of which she had
not even the most remote conception.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if that&#8217;s so&mdash;if he can&#8217;t be trusted any longer,&#8221;
she said aloud, stung by a sudden, sharp realization
of the gravity of such a situation, &#8220;what am I to
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of his own accord Freckles had turned aside into
the little curved depression in the cliffs and was plodding
slowly up the trail. Staring blindly at the rough,
ragged cliffs and peaks ahead of her, the girl was suddenly
overwhelmed by a feeling of helplessness. If
Lynch failed her, what could she do? Whom could
she turn to for help or even for counsel? There was
Alf Manning, but Alf knew nothing whatever of
range conditions, and besides neither he nor Stella expected
to stay on indefinitely. Her mind ranged
swiftly over other more or less remote possibilities,
but save for a few distant cousins with whom they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
never been on intimate terms, she could think of no
one. She even considered for a moment Jim Tenny
of the Rocking-R, whom she had met and liked, or Dr.
Blanchard, but a sudden reviving burst of spirit caused
her quickly to dismiss the thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d think I was a silly, hysterical idiot,&#8221; she
murmured. &#8220;Why, I couldn&#8217;t even tell them what I
was afraid of. I wonder if it can possibly be just
nerves? It doesn&#8217;t seem as if&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke off abruptly and tightened on her reins.
Freckles had carried her over the summit of the trail
and had almost reached the hollow on the other side,
formed by the bottom of a gully that crossed the path.
Mary had once explored it and knew that to the left it
deepened into a gloomy gulch that hugged the cliff for
some distance and then curved abruptly to the south.
So far as she knew, it led nowhere, and yet, to her
astonishment, not a hundred feet away a saddled
horse, with bridle-reins trailing, stood cropping the
leaves of a stunted mesquite.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny,&#8221; she said aloud in a low tone.</p>
<p>As she spoke the horse threw up his head and stared
at her, ears pointed inquiringly. When Freckles nickered,
the strange animal gave an answering whinny,
but did not move.</p>
<p>Puzzled and a little nervous, Mary glanced sharply
to right and left amongst the scattered rocks. In her
experience a saddled horse meant that the owner was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
not far away; but she could see no signs of any one,
and at length, taking courage from the silence, she
rode slowly forward.</p>
<p>As she came closer the horse backed away a foot or
two and half turned, exposing a brand on his shoulder.
The girl stared at it with a puckered frown, wondering
what on earth any one from the Rocking-R was doing
here. Then her glance strayed to the saddle, flittered
indifferently over cantle and skirts, to pause abruptly,
with a sudden keen attention, on the flap of the right-hand
pocket, which bore the initials &#8220;R. S.&#8221; cut with
some skill on the smooth leather.</p>
<p>With eyes widening, the girl bent forward, studying
the flap intently. She was not mistaken; the initials
<i>were</i> R. S., and in a flash there came back to her a
memory of that afternoon, which seemed so long ago,
when she and Buck Green rode out together to the
south pasture. She had noticed those initials then
on his saddle-pocket, and knowing how unusual it was
for a cow-man to touch his precious saddle with a
knife, she made some casual comment, and learned how
it had come into Buck&#8217;s possession.</p>
<p>What did it mean? What was <i>he</i> doing here on a
Rocking-R horse? Above all, where was he?</p>
<p>Suddenly her heart began to beat unevenly and her
frightened eyes stared down the gulch to where an
out-thrust buttress provokingly hid the greater part
of it from view. Her glance shifted again to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
horse, who stood motionless, regarding her with liquid,
intelligent eyes, and for the first time she noticed that
the ends of the trailing reins were scratched and torn
and ragged.</p>
<p>How still the place was! She fumbled in her blouse,
and drawing forth a handkerchief, passed it mechanically
over her damp forehead. Then abruptly her
slight figure straightened, and tightening the reins she
urged Freckles along the rock-strewn bottom of the
gulch.</p>
<p>The distance to the rocky buttress seemed at once
interminable and incredibly short. As she reached it
she held her breath and her teeth dug into her colorless
lips. But when another section of the winding
gorge lay before her, silent, empty save for scattered
boulders and a few scanty bits of stunted vegetation,
one small, gloved hand fluttered to her breast, then
dropped, clenched, against the saddle-horn.</p>
<p>A rounded mass of rock, fallen in ages past from
the cliffs above, blocked her path, and mechanically
the girl reined Freckles around it. An instant later
the horse stopped of his own accord, and the girl
found herself staring down with horror-stricken eyes
at the body of a man stretched out on the further side
of the boulders. Motionless he lay there, a long
length of brown chaps and torn, disordered shirt.
His face was hidden in his crooked arms; the tumbled
mass of brown hair was matted with ominous dark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
clots. But in that single, stricken second Mary
Thorne knew whom she had found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she choked, fighting desperately against a
wave of faintness that threatened to overwhelm her.
&#8220;O-h!&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly the man&#8217;s face lifted, and two bloodshot eyes
regarded her dully through a matted lock of hair
that lay stiffly plastered against his forehead. With
a curious, stealthy movement, one hand twisted back
to his side and fumbled there for an instant. Then
the man groaned softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot,&#8221; he mumbled. &#8220;It&#8217;s gone. You&mdash;you&#8217;ve
got me this time, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Face drained to paper-white and lips quivering,
Mary Thorne slid out of her saddle, steadied herself
against the horse for a second, and then dropped on
her knees beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck!&#8221; she cried in a shaking voice. &#8220;You&mdash;you&#8217;re
hurt! What&mdash;what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>A puzzled look came into his face, and as he stared
into the wide, frightened hazel eyes so close to his,
recognition slowly dawned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;What&mdash;How&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She twined her fingers together to stop their trembling.
&#8220;I was riding through the pass,&#8221; she told him
briefly. &#8220;I saw your horse and I&mdash;I was&mdash;afraid&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint gleam came into the bloodshot eyes. &#8220;My&mdash;my
horse? You mean a&mdash;a Rocking-R cayuse?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tried to sit up, but the effort turned him so white
that the girl cried out protestingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t. You&#8217;re badly hurt. I&mdash;I&#8217;ll ride
back for help.&#8221; She sprang to her feet. &#8220;But first
I must get you water.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared at her as one regards a desert mirage.
&#8220;Water!&#8221; he repeated unbelievingly. &#8220;You know
where&mdash;If you could&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden moisture dimmed her eyes, but she winked
it resolutely back. &#8220;There&#8217;s a little spring the other
side of the trail,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;You lie quietly and
I&#8217;ll be back in just a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stumbling in her haste, she turned and ran past the
buttress and on toward the trail. Not a hundred feet
beyond, a tiny spring bubbled up in the rocks, and
dropping down beside it, the girl jerked the pins from
her hat and let the cool water trickle into the capacious
crown of the Stetson. It seemed to take an eternity
to fill, but at length the water ran over the brim, and
carefully guarding her precious burden, she hurried
back again.</p>
<p>The man was watching for her&mdash;eagerly, longingly,
with an underlying touch of apprehensive doubt, as if
he half feared to find her merely one of those dreamlike
phantoms that had haunted him through the long,
painful hours. As the girl sank down beside him,
there was a look in his eyes that sent a strange thrill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
through her and caused her hands to tremble, sending
a little stream of water trickling over the soggy hat-brim
to the ground.</p>
<p>She steadied herself resolutely and bending forward
held the hat against Buck&#8217;s lips. As he plunged his
face into it and began to suck up the water in great,
famished gulps, the girl&#8217;s lips quivered, and her eyes,
resting on the matted tangle of dark hair, filled with
sudden tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>NERVE</h3>
</div>

<p>With a deep sigh, Buck lifted his face from
the water and regarded her gratefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;That just about saved my life,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>Mary Thorne carefully set down the improvised
water-bucket, its contents much depleted, and taking
out her handkerchief, soaked it thoroughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully stupid about first aid,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But your head must be badly cut, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; he protested, as the moist bit of cambric
touched his hair. &#8220;You&#8217;ll spoil it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As if that mattered!&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;Just rest
your head on your arms; it&#8217;ll be easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>With deft, gentle touches, she cleaned away the
blood and grime, parting his thick hair now and then
with delicate care. Her hands were steady now, and
having steeled herself for anything, the sight of a
jagged, ugly-looking cut on his scalp did not make her
flinch. She even bent forward a little to examine it
more closely, and saw that a ridge of clotted blood had
temporarily stopped its oozing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better let it alone,&#8221; she said aloud. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
might start it bleeding again. How&mdash;how did it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck raised his head and regarded her with a slow,
thoughtful stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fell off the cliff back there,&#8221; he replied at length.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. &#8220;You&mdash;fell off the cliff!&#8221; she
gasped. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder&mdash; But is this the only place
you&#8217;re hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>His lips twisted in a grim smile. &#8220;Oh, no! I&#8217;ve
got a sprained ankle and what feels like a broken rib,
though it may be only bruises. But as you&#8217;re thinking,
I&#8217;m darned lucky to get off alive. I must have
struck a ledge or something part way down, but how I
managed from there I haven&#8217;t the least idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hands clenched together in her lap, she stared at
him in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought perhaps you might be strong enough in
a little while to ride back with me to the ranch. I&mdash;I
could help you mount, and we could go very slowly.
But of course that&#8217;s impossible. I&#8217;d better start at
once and bring back some of the men.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made a move to rise, but he stopped her with
a quick, imperative gesture. &#8220;No, you mustn&#8217;t,&#8221; he
said firmly. &#8220;That won&#8217;t do at all. I can&#8217;t go to the
ranch.&#8221; He paused, his forehead wrinkled thoughtfully.
&#8220;You may not have guessed it, but Lynch and
I don&#8217;t pull together at all,&#8221; he finished, with a whimsical
intonation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But surely that wouldn&#8217;t make any difference&mdash;now!&#8221;
she protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the difference that he&#8217;d have me just where
he wanted me,&#8221; he retorted. He was regarding her
with a steady, questioning stare, and presently he gave
a little sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to tell you something I didn&#8217;t
mean to,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In my opinion Tex Lynch is
pretty much of a scoundrel. He knows I know it, and
there isn&#8217;t anything he wouldn&#8217;t do to shut my mouth&mdash;for
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>To his amazement, instead of showing the indignation
he expected, the girl merely stared at him in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You believe that, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it. But I thought you trusted&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t any longer.&#8221; She was surprised at the immensity
of the relief that surged over her at this chance
to unburden her soul of the load of perplexity and
trouble which harassed her. &#8220;For a long time I
haven&#8217;t&mdash;There&#8217;ve been a number of things. I still
haven&#8217;t an idea of what it&#8217;s all about, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad you feel that way,&#8221; Buck said,
as she paused. &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure myself just what
he&#8217;s up to, but I believe I&#8217;m on the right trail.&#8221; Very
briefly he told her of the steps he had taken since
leaving the Shoe-Bar. &#8220;You see how impossible it
would be to trust myself in his power again,&#8221; he concluded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>For a moment or two Mary Thorne sat silent, regarding
him with a curious expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that was the reason,&#8221; she murmured at length.</p>
<p>His eyes questioned her mutely, and a slow flush
crept into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason you&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t say you had no&mdash;special
object in being on the Shoe-Bar,&#8221; she explained
haltingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;sorry I didn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t very well tell you without running
the risk of Lynch&#8217;s finding out. As it happened, I
was trying my best to think up a reasonable excuse
for leaving the outfit to do some investigating from
this end, so you really did me a good turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Investigating what? Haven&#8217;t you any idea what
he&#8217;s up to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck hesitated. &#8220;A very little, but it&#8217;s too indefinite
to put into words just yet. I&#8217;ve a feeling I&#8217;ll
get at the bottom of it soon, though, and then
I&#8217;ll tell you. In the meantime, when you go back,
don&#8217;t breathe a word of having seen me, and on no account
let any one persuade you to&mdash;sell the outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stared at him with crinkled brows. &#8220;But what
are you going to do now?&#8221; she asked suddenly, her
mind flashing back to the present difficulty.</p>
<p>He dragged himself into a sitting posture. He was
evidently feeling stronger and looked much more like
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try and get back to that camp of mine I told you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
of,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll have to lay up there
a while, but there&#8217;s food a-plenty, and a good spring,
so&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe you can even stand,&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;And if your ribs are broken&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely it&#8217;s only one and I can strap that good and
tight with a piece of my shirt or something. Then
if you could catch Pete and bring him over here, I&#8217;ll
manage to climb into the saddle some way. It&#8217;s only
three or four miles, and the going&#8217;s not so very bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made no further protest, but her lips straightened
firmly and there was a look of decision in her
girlish face as she set about helping him with his preparations.</p>
<p>It was she who tore a broad band from his flannel
shirt, roughly fringed the ends with Buck&#8217;s knife and
tied it so tightly about his body that he had hard work
to keep from wincing. She insisted on bandaging
his head, and while he rested in the shade went back
into the gulch to look for his hat and the Colt that
had fallen from his holster.</p>
<p>She finally found them both under a narrow ledge
that thrust out a dozen feet below the edge of the
trail. A stunted bush, rooted deep in some hidden
crevice, grew up before it, and, staring upward at it,
the girl guessed that to this little bush alone Buck
owed his life. He had been able to give her no further
details of his descent, but she saw that it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
be possible for a man to crawl along the narrow
ledge to where another crossed it at a descending angle,
and thence gain the bottom of the gulch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how he ever came to fall,&#8221; she murmured,
remembering how wide the trail was at the summit.</p>
<p>Returning, however, she asked no questions. In
the face of what lay before her, the matter seemed
trivial and unimportant. She caught the Rocking-R
horse without much trouble and led him back to a
broad, flat boulder on which Buck had managed to
crawl. Obliged to hold the animal, whose slightest
movement might prove disastrous, she could give no
further aid, but was forced to stand helpless, watching
with troubled, sympathetic eyes the man&#8217;s painful
struggles to gain the saddle. When at last he succeeded
and slumped there, mouth twisted and face
bathed in perspiration, her knees were shaking and she
felt limp and nerveless.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stop at the spring first for more water,&#8221;
she said, pulling herself together with an effort.</p>
<p>Too exhausted for speech, Buck merely nodded,
and the girl, gathering up Freckles&#8217;s bridle in her other
hand, led the two horses slowly toward the trail. At
the spring Buck drank deeply of the water she handed
him, and seemed much refreshed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he murmured, with an effort to
straighten his bent body. &#8220;Well, I reckon I&#8217;d better
be starting. I&mdash;I can&#8217;t thank you enough for all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
you&#8217;ve done, Miss&mdash;Thorne. It was mighty plucky&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t waste your strength talking,&#8221; she
interrupted quietly. &#8220;Just tell me which way to go,
and we&#8217;ll start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; he repeated sharply. &#8220;But you&#8217;re not going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am. Did you think for a moment
I&#8217;d let you take that ride alone?&#8221; She smiled faintly
with a brave attempt at lightness. &#8220;You&#8217;d be falling
off and breaking another rib. Please don&#8217;t make
difficulties. I&#8217;m going with you, and that&#8217;s an end
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the firmness of her manner made Buck
realize the futility of further protest, or possibly he
was in no condition to argue. At all events he gave
in, and when the girl swung herself into the saddle,
the slow journey began.</p>
<p>To Mary Thorne the memory of it remained ever
afterward in her mind a chaotic medley of strange
emotions and impressions, vague yet vivid. At first,
where the width of the trail permitted it, she rode
beside him, making an effort to talk casually and
lightly, yet not too constantly, but continually keeping
a watchful eye on the drooping figure at her right,
whose hands presently sought and gripped the saddle-horn.</p>
<p>When they left the trail for rougher ground, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
dismounted in spite of Buck&#8217;s protest, and walked beside
him, and it was well she did. Once when the
horse slipped or stumbled on a loose stone and the
man&#8217;s body swayed perilously in the saddle, she put
up both hands swiftly and held him there.</p>
<p>Before they had gone a mile her boots began to hurt
her, but the pain was so trifling in comparison with
what Buck must be suffering that she scarcely noticed
it. He was putting up a brave front, but there
were signs that were difficult to conceal, and toward the
end of that toilsome journey it was evident that he
could not possibly have kept his seat much longer.
Indeed, when they had ridden the short length of the
little cañon and stopped before the overhanging shelf
of rocks, he toppled suddenly sidewise, and only the
girl&#8217;s frail body prevented him from crashing roughly
to the ground.</p>
<p>She brought him water from the spring, and searching
through his belongings found a flask of brandy and
forced some between his teeth. When he had recovered
from his momentary faintness, she managed
somehow to get him over to the blankets spread beneath
the ledge. Then she built a fire and set some
coffee on it to boil, unsaddled Pete, fed and watered
the three horses, finally returning with a cup of steaming
liquid to where Buck lay exhausted with closed
eyes.</p>
<p>His face was drawn and haggard, and his lashes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
long and soft and thick, lay against a skin drained
of every particle of color. A sudden choking sob rose
to the girl&#8217;s lips, but she managed to force it back, and
when the man&#8217;s lids slowly lifted, she smiled tremulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s some coffee,&#8221; she said, kneeling down and
holding the rim of the cup to his lips.</p>
<p>Buck drank obediently in slow gulps.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all nerve,&#8221; he murmured when the cup was
empty. He lay silent for a few moments. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you think you&#8217;d better be starting back?&#8221; he asked
at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I go and leave you like this?&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;You&#8217;re so weak. You might get fever.
Anything might happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you certainly can&#8217;t stay,&#8221; he retorted with unexpected
decision. &#8220;Let alone a whole lot of other
reasons,&#8221; he went on, watching her mutinous face,
&#8220;if you did, Tex would have a posse out hunting for
you in no time. Sooner or later they&#8217;d find this place,
and you know what that would mean. I&#8217;m feeling
better every minute&mdash;honest. By to-morrow I&#8217;ll be
able to hobble around and look after myself fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>His logic was irresistible, and for a time she sat
silent, torn by a conflict of emotions. Then all at
once her face brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I send Bud
out? He&#8217;s to be trusted surely?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s eyes lit up in a way that brought to the girl
a curious, jealous pang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud? Sure, he&#8217;s all right. That&#8217;s one fine idea.
You&#8217;ll have to be careful Lynch doesn&#8217;t know where
he&#8217;s going, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll manage that all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reluctant to go, yet feeling that she ought to make
haste, the girl got out some crackers and placed them,
with a pail of water, within his reach. Then she
listened while Stratton told her of a short cut out to
the middle pasture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;You&#8217;ll promise to
be careful, won&#8217;t you? Bud ought to be here in a
couple of hours, though he may be delayed a little
longer. You&#8217;d better not try and move until he
comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; Buck answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m too darn comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-by, then,&#8221; she said briefly, moving over
to her horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by; and&mdash;thank you a thousand times!&#8221;</p>
<p>She made no answer, but a faint, enigmatic smile
quivered for an instant on her lips as she turned the
stirrup and swung herself into the saddle. When
Freckles had reached a little distance, she glanced back
and waved her hand. From where he lay Stratton
could see almost the whole length of the little cañon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
and as long as the slight figure on the big gray horse
remained in sight, his eyes followed her intently, a
sort of wistful hunger in their depths. But when she
disappeared, the man&#8217;s head fell back limply on the
blankets and his eyes closed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>WHERE THE WHEEL TRACKS LED</h3>
</div>

<p>Bud Jessup removed a battered stew-pan from
the fire and set it aside to cool a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, by this time I reckon friend Tex is all
worked up over what&#8217;s become of me,&#8221; he remarked
in a tone of satisfaction, deftly shifting the coffee-pot
to a bed of deeper coals. &#8220;He&#8217;s sure tried often
enough to get rid of me, but I don&#8217;t guess he quite
relishes my droppin&#8217; out of sight like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck Stratton, his back resting comfortably against
a rock a little way from the fire, nodded absently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure you didn&#8217;t leave any trace they could
pick up?&#8221; he asked with a touch of anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain sure,&#8221; returned Jessup confidently. &#8220;When
Miss Mary came in around four, I was in the wagon-shed,
the rest of the crowd bein&#8217; down in south pasture.
Like I told yuh before, she had a good-sized
package all done up nice in her hand, an&#8217; it didn&#8217;t
take her long to tell me what was up. Then we walks
out together an&#8217; stops by the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yuh better get yore supper at the hotel,&#8217; she says,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
an&#8217; ride back afterwards. &#8216;I meant to send in right
after dinner to mail the package, but I got held up out
on the range.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she seems to catch sight of the greaser for
the first time jest inside the door, though I noticed
him snoopin&#8217; there when we first come up.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I hope yuh got somethin&#8217; left from dinner, Pedro,&#8217;
she says, with one of them careless natural smiles of
hers, like as if she hadn&#8217;t a care on her mind except
food. &#8216;I&#8217;m half starved.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud sighed and finished with a note of admiration.
&#8220;Some girl, all right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said it,&#8221; agreed Buck fervently.</p>
<p>His appearance had improved surprisingly in the
ten days that had passed since his accident. The head-bandage
was gone, and his swollen ankle, though still
tender at times, had been reduced to almost normal
size by constant applications of cold water. His body
was still tightly strapped up with yards and yards of
bandage, which Mary Thorne had thoughtfully packed,
with a number of other first-aid necessities, in the
parcel which was Bud&#8217;s excuse for making a trip to
town.</p>
<p>Stratton was not certain that a rib had been
broken after all. When Jessup came to examine him
he found the flesh terribly bruised and refrained from
any unnecessary prodding. It was still somewhat
painful to the touch, but from the ease with which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
could get about, Buck had a notion that at the worst
the bone was merely cracked.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t be likely to notice where you left
the Paloma trail, would they?&#8221; Buck asked, after a
brief retrospective silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless they&#8217;re a whole lot better trackers than
I think for,&#8221; Jessup assured him. &#8220;I picked a rocky
place this side of the gully, an&#8217; cut around the north
end of middle pasture, where the land slopes down a
bit, an&#8217; yuh can&#8217;t be seen from the south more &#8217;n a
quarter of a mile. I kept my eyes peeled, believe me!
an&#8217; didn&#8217;t glimpse a soul all the way. I wouldn&#8217;t
fret none about their followin&#8217; me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it is foolish,&#8221; admitted Stratton. &#8220;But
lying around not able to do anything makes a fellow
think up all kinds of trouble. Lynch isn&#8217;t a fool,
and there&#8217;s no doubt when you didn&#8217;t come back that
night he&#8217;d begin to smell a rat right off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. An&#8217; next day he likely sent in to town,
where he&#8217;d find out from old Pop that I never showed
up there at all. After that, accordin&#8217; to my figgerin&#8217;,
he&#8217;d be up against it hard. Yuh can bank on Miss
Mary playin&#8217; the game, an&#8217; registerin&#8217; surprise an&#8217;
worry an&#8217; all the rest of it. There ain&#8217;t a chance in
the world of his thinkin&#8217; to look for me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s true. Of course we&#8217;ve got to remember
that so far as he knows I&#8217;m out of the way
for good.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>Bud took up coffee-pot and stew-pan and set them
down beside Stratton, where the rest of the meal was
spread.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he chuckled, dropping down against the
ledge. &#8220;Officially, you&#8217;re a corpse. That&#8217;s yore
strong point, old-timer. By golly!&#8221; he added, with a
sudden, fierce revulsion of spirit. &#8220;I only hope I&#8217;ll
be on hand when he gets what&#8217;s comin&#8217; to him, the
damn&#8217;, cowardly skunk!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you will,&#8221; commented Buck grimly. &#8220;Well,
let&#8217;s eat. Seems like I do nothing but eat and sleep
and loaf around. I&#8217;ve a good notion to bust up the
monotony,&#8221; he added, after a few minutes had passed
in the silent consumption of food, &#8220;and take that trip
to north pasture to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be loco,&#8221; Bud told him hastily. &#8220;Yuh ain&#8217;t
fit for nothin&#8217; like that yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did it a few days ago,&#8221; Stratton reminded
him, &#8220;and I&#8217;m feeling a hundred per cent. better
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe so; but what&#8217;s the use in takin&#8217; chances?
We got plenty of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that,&#8221; Buck said seriously.
&#8220;You say that Lynch thinks I&#8217;m dead and out of the
way. Well, maybe he does; but unless he&#8217;s a lot
bigger fool than I think for, he&#8217;s not going to leave
a body around in plain sight for anybody to find.
He&#8217;ll be slipping down into that gulch one of these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
days to get rid of it, and when he finds there ain&#8217;t any
body&mdash;then what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll begin to see he&#8217;s got into one hell of a mess,
I reckon,&#8221; commented Jessup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. And he&#8217;ll be willing to do anything on
earth to crawl out safe. Like enough he&#8217;ll connect
your disappearance with the business, and that would
worry him more than ever. He might even get scared
enough to throw up the whole game and beat it; and
believe me, that wouldn&#8217;t suit me at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh said a mouthful!&#8221; snarled Jessup. &#8220;If that
hellion should get away&mdash;Say, Buck, why couldn&#8217;t
yuh get him for attempted murder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might, but the witnesses are all on his side, and
there&#8217;d be a good chance of his slipping out. Besides,
I&#8217;m set on finding out first what his game is. I&#8217;m
dead certain now it&#8217;s connected somehow with the
north pasture, and I&#8217;ve an idea it&#8217;s something big.
That car I told you about, and everything&mdash;Well,
there&#8217;s no sense guessing any longer when we can
make a stab at finding out. We&#8217;ll start the first thing
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud made no further protest, and at dawn next
morning they left camp and set out northward through
the hills. It was a slow journey, and toward the end
of it Buck felt rather seedy. But this was only natural,
he told himself, after lying around and doing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
nothing; and he even wished he had made the move
sooner.</p>
<p>Both he and Jessup were conscious of a growing
excitement as they neared the goal from which circumstances
had held them back so long. Were they
going to find out something definite at last? Or
would fate thrust another unexpected obstacle in their
way? Above all, if fortune proved kind, what would
be the character of their discovery?</p>
<p>Immensely intrigued and curious, Bud chattered
constantly throughout the ride, suggesting all sorts of
solutions of the problem, some of which were rather
far-fetched. Gold was his favorite&mdash;as it has been the
favorite lure for adventurers all down the ages&mdash;and he
drew an entrancing picture of desert sands sprinkled
with the yellow dust. He thought of other precious
metals, too, and even gave a passing consideration to
a deposit of diamonds or some other precious or semi-precious
stones. Once he switched off oddly on the
subject of prehistoric remains, and Stratton&#8217;s surprised
inquiry revealed the fact that three years ago
he had worked for a party of scientific excavators in
Montana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them bones and skeletons as big as houses bring
a pile of money, believe me!&#8221; he assured his companion.
&#8220;The country up there ain&#8217;t a mite different
from this, neither.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>Buck himself was unusually silent and abstracted.
During the last ten days of enforced idleness he had
considered the subject for hours at a time and from
every conceivable angle, with the result that a certain
possibility occurred to him and persisted in lingering
in his mind, in spite of its seeming improbability. It
was so vague and unlikely that he said nothing about it
to Bud; but now, mounting the steep trail, the thought
of it came back with gathering strength, and he wondered
whether it could possibly be true.</p>
<p>Advancing with every possible precaution, they
gained the summit and passed on down the other side.
Before them lay the desert, glittering and glowing in
the morning sun, without a sign of alien presence.
Keeping a sharp lookout, they reached the little, half-circular
recess in the cliffs that formed the end of the
trail, and paused.</p>
<p>No rain had fallen in the last ten days and the print
of motor-tires was almost as clear and unmistakable
as the day it had been made. They could make
out easily where the car had been driven in, the footprints
about it, and the marks left by its turning; and
with equal lack of difficulty they picked out the track
made as it departed.</p>
<p>The latter headed north, but Stratton was not interested
in it. Without hesitation he selected the incoming
trail, and the two followed it out into the
desert. For a few hundred yards they rode almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
due east. Then the wheel-marks turned abruptly to
the south, and a little further on Buck noted the prints
of a galloping horse beside them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lynch, I reckon,&#8221; he commented, pointing them out
to his companion. &#8220;When he saw me up on the cliffs
down yonder, he must have hustled to catch up with
the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither of them spoke again until they reached the
spot where Buck had seen the car stop and the men
get out and walk about. Here they dismounted and
followed the footprints with careful scrutiny. Bud
saw nothing significant, and when they had covered
the ground thoroughly, he expressed his disappointment
freely. Stratton merely shrugged his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll follow the back track and see where else
they stopped,&#8221; he said curtly.</p>
<p>His voice was a little hoarse, and there was an odd
gleam in his eyes. When they were in the saddle
again, he urged his horse forward at a speed which
presently brought a protest from Jessup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh better take it easy, old man,&#8221; he cautioned.
&#8220;If that cayuse steps in a hole, you&#8217;re apt to get a jolt
that&#8217;ll put you out of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t guess it&#8217;ll hurt me,&#8221; returned Stratton
with preoccupied brevity.</p>
<p>Bud gave a resigned shrug, and for ten minutes the
silence remained unbroken. Then all at once Buck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
gave a muttered exclamation and pulled his horse up
with a jerk.</p>
<p>They were on the rim of a wide, shallow depression
in the sand. There was nothing remarkable about it
at first sight, save, perhaps, the total absence of desert
vegetation for some distance all around. But Stratton
slid hastily out of his saddle, flung the reins over Pete&#8217;s
head, and walked swiftly forward. Thrilled with a
sudden excitement and suspense, Bud followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he questioned eagerly, as Buck bent
down to scoop up a handful of the trampled sand.
&#8220;What have yuh&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly as Stratton turned suddenly
on him, eyes dilated and a spot of vivid color glowing
on each cheek-bone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; he demanded, thrusting his hand
toward the boy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Staring at the open palm, Jessup&#8217;s eyes widened
and his jaw dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that
it&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused incredulously, and Buck nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it,&#8221; he stated crisply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE SECRET OF NORTH PASTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Jessup swallowed hard. &#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;&#8221; he faltered,
&#8220;there ain&#8217;t never been any found around
here. The nearest fields are hundreds of miles away,
ain&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton dropped the lump of sand. A number of
particles still clung to his palm, and over the skin
there spread an oily, slightly iridescent film. His
manner had suddenly grown composed, though his
eyes still shone with suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, it&#8217;s&mdash;oil!&#8221; he returned quietly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt at all about it. Look at the ground
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mechanically Bud&#8217;s glance shifted to the wide, shallow
depression in the desert. The sand was noticeably
darker, and here and there under the sun&#8217;s rays,
it held that faintly iridescent glint that was unmistakable.
At a distance he would have said there was
a spring somewhere beneath the surface. But no
water ever had that look, and now that he was prepared
for it he even noticed a faint, distinctive odor
in the air.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;By golly!&#8221; he cried excitedly. &#8220;You mean to say
the whole pasture&#8217;s full of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not likely, but it looks to me as if there was a-plenty.
There were traces back there where we stopped,
and there&#8217;s no telling how many more&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t see nothin&#8217;,&#8221; interrupted Bud in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t looking for it, that&#8217;s why,&#8221; shrugged
Stratton. &#8220;I was. Thinking it all over this past
week, I got to wondering if oil might not just possibly
be what we ought to look for. I was so doubtful I
didn&#8217;t say anything about it. Like you said, nobody&#8217;s
ever struck it anywhere around these parts,
but I reckon you never can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wough!&#8221; Bud suddenly exploded in a tremendous
exhalation of breath. &#8220;I can&#8217;t seem to get it
through my nut. Why, it means a fortune for Miss
Mary! No wonder that skunk tried his best to do her
out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck stared at him oddly. A fortune for Mary
Thorne! Somehow, until this moment he had not
realized that this must seem to every one to be the object
of his efforts&mdash;to rid Mary Thorne of all her cares
and troubles and bring her measureless prosperity.
Ignorant of Stratton&#8217;s identity and of all the circumstances
of her father&#8217;s treachery and double-dealing,
she must hold that view herself. The thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
disturbed Buck, and he wondered uncomfortably what
her feelings would be when she learned the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; inquired Bud suddenly.
&#8220;What yuh scowlin&#8217; that way for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing special,&#8221; evaded Buck. &#8220;I was just thinking.&#8221;
After all, there was no use crossing bridges
until one came to them. &#8220;We&#8217;d better get started,&#8221;
he added briskly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve found out all we want
here, and there&#8217;s no sense in taking chances of running
up against the gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the next move?&#8221; asked Bud, when they
had mounted and started back over their trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look up Hardenberg and put him wise to
what we know,&#8221; answered Stratton promptly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve done about all we can; the rest of it&#8217;s up to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon so,&#8221; agreed Jessup. &#8220;I never met up with
him, but they say he&#8217;s a good skate. Perilla&#8217;s some
little jaunt from here, though. Yuh thinkin&#8217; of riding
all the way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? It&#8217;ll be quicker in the end than going
to Harpswell and taking the train. We&#8217;ll likely need
the cayuses, too, when we get there. I&#8217;ve done forty
miles at a stretch plenty of times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8217;ve I, but not with a bad ankle and a bunged-up
side,&#8221; returned Bud dryly. &#8220;How yuh feelin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine! I&#8217;ve hardly had a twinge all day. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
bandage stuff is great dope for keeping a fellow strapped
up comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re up to it, I reckon that would be
better than the train,&#8221; Bud admitted. &#8220;For one thing,
if we take the trail around south of the Rocking-R we
ain&#8217;t likely to meet up with anybody who&#8217;ll put Lynch
wise, an&#8217; I take it that&#8217;s important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say so!&#8221; agreed Buck emphatically. &#8220;The
chances are that even if he got wind of you and me
being together, he&#8217;d realize the game was up, and
probably beat it for the border. As long as we can
manage to keep out of the spot-light, he may suspect
a lot of things, but considering the size of the stake,
he&#8217;s likely to take a chance and hang on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope he don&#8217;t take it into his head to ride up
here this morning,&#8221; remarked Jessup, glancing apprehensively
across the desert wastes toward the south.
&#8220;That would spill the beans for fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>The very possibility made them urge the horses to
an even greater speed, and neither of them really
breathed freely until they had gained the little sheltered
depression in the cliffs, from which the trail led
over the shoulder of the mountain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;re safe enough now,&#8221; commented
Stratton, drawing rein. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see a sign of anybody
as we came along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halting for ten minutes to rest the horses, they
started up the trail in single file, Bud going first. For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
a greater part of the distance the rocky spurs shielded
them from any save a very limited field of observation.
But at the summit there was an almost level stretch
of twenty feet or more from which an extended view
could be had, not only of a wide sweep of desert
country, but of a section of the northern end of middle
pasture as well. Reaching this point, Buck glanced
back searchingly. An instant later he was out of
the saddle and crouching against the rocky wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead Pete around the corner,&#8221; he urged Jessup
sharply. &#8220;Get out of sight as quick as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud obeyed without question, and Stratton hastily
took out his field-glasses and focused them on the
three figures he had glimpsed riding along the northern
extremity of the Shoe-Bar pasture. He recognized
them instantly, pausing only long enough to
make out that they did not seem to be in haste, and
that so far as he could tell they were not looking in
the direction of the trail. Then he thrust the glasses
back into the case, and slipping around the buttress
rejoined his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lynch, with McCabe and Kreeger,&#8221; he explained
curtly, gathering up the reins and swinging himself
into the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they see yuh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. They seemed to be taking things
easy, and weren&#8217;t looking this way at all. I wonder
what they&#8217;re up to?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we stick around here for a while and
watch them?&#8221; Bud asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Buck hesitated an instant. &#8220;I guess we&#8217;d better
not take a chance,&#8221; he replied at length. &#8220;Such a
whale of a lot depends on his not knowing that I&#8217;m
alive and kicking; I&#8217;d hate like the devil to spoil everything
now by his getting a glimpse of me. Besides,
for all we know they may be coming through here
to meet somebody&mdash;the rest of the gang, perhaps,
or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; interrupted Bud hastily. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.
Sooner we&#8217;re off this here trail the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further delay they rode on down the slope,
paused for a moment or two at the spring in the hollow
to water the horses, and then pushed on again. Passing
the entrance to the gulch, Jessup glanced that way
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe they&#8217;re on their way to dispose of yore
corpse, Buck,&#8221; he chuckled.</p>
<p>Stratton grinned. &#8220;I thought of that, and I rather
hope it&#8217;s so. They&#8217;d be puzzled and suspicious,
maybe, but they couldn&#8217;t be really sure of anything.
It would be a whole lot better than to have them run
across our tracks in the sand back there. That would
give away the show completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes or so later they reached the gully
through which they had come out on the trail.
Though there had been no further signs of the Shoe-Bar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
men, their vigilance did not relax. Pushing on
with all possible speed, they covered the distance to
the little camp in very much less time than it had taken
in the morning.</p>
<p>Here the horses had a brief rest while the two men
collected their few belongings and loaded them on the
pack-horse, for they had decided to go on at once.
Both felt that no time should be lost in finding the
sheriff and setting the machinery of the law in motion.
Moreover, they were down to the last scrap of food
and unless they stirred themselves they were likely
to go hungry that night.</p>
<p>An hour later found them riding southward, following
the route through the mountains used by the cattle-rustlers.
Making the same cautious circuit Buck had
taken around the southern end of the Shoe-Bar, they
reached Rocking-R land without adventure and pulled
up before the door of Red Butte camp about six
o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>Gabby Smith was cooking supper and greeted them
with his customary lack of enthusiasm. Bud, who
had never seen him before, was much diverted by his
manner, and during the meal kept up a constant chatter
of comment and question for the purpose, as he afterward
confessed, of making the taciturn puncher go the
limit in the matter of loquacity. His effort, though
it could scarcely be termed successful, evidently got
on Gabby&#8217;s nerves, for afterward he turned both men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
out of the cabin while he cleared up, a process lasting
until nearly bedtime.</p>
<p>It was not until then that Stratton, by a chance remark,
learned that three or four days after his departure
from the camp two weeks earlier, a stranger had
been there making inquiries about him. Gabby&#8217;s
stenographic brevity made it difficult to extract details,
but apparently the fellow had passed himself off as
an old friend of Buck&#8217;s from Texas, desirous of looking
him up. He was a stranger to Gabby, slight,
dark, with eyes set rather closely together, and he rode
a Shoe-Bar horse. Apparently he had hung around
camp until nearly dusk, and then departed only when
Gabby got rid of him by suggesting that his man had
probably ridden in to spend the night at the Rocking-R
ranch-house.</p>
<p>Stratton and Jessup discussed the incident while
making brief preparation for bed. So far as Bud
knew there had been no stranger on the Shoe-Bar at
that time; but it seemed certain that the fellow must
have been sent by Lynch to spy around and find out
where Buck was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose he went to the ranch-house first and Tenny
sent him down here, knowing he wouldn&#8217;t get much
out of Gabby,&#8221; remarked Stratton. &#8220;Well, as far as
I can see he had his trouble for his pains. Unless he
hung around for two or three days he couldn&#8217;t very
well be certain I wasn&#8217;t somewhere on the ranch.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>Save as a matter of curiosity, however, the whole
affair lay too far in the past to be of the least importance
now, and it was soon dismissed. Having removed
boots and outer clothing, and spread their
blankets in one of the pair of double-decked bunks, the
two men lost no time crawling between them, and fell
almost instantly asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE TRAP</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Yuh out last night?&#8221; brusquely inquired Gabby,
as they were dressing next morning.</p>
<p>A direct question from the eccentric individual was
so novel that Buck paused in buckling on his cartridge-belt,
and stared at him in frank surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; he returned promptly. &#8220;Were you,
Bud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure wasn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t budge after my head
hit the mattress. What gave yuh the notion, old-timer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Door unlatched,&#8221; growled Gabby, continuing his
preparations for breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; shrugged Bud. &#8220;Likely nobody
thought to close it tight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gabby made no answer, but his expression, as he
went silently about his work, failed to show conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he a scream?&#8221; inquired Bud an hour later,
when they had saddled up and were on their way. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t wonder Tenny can&#8217;t get nobody to stay in camp
with him. It would be about as cheerful as a morgue.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Must have got soured in his youth,&#8221; remarked
Stratton. &#8220;I had to put up a regular fight to get him
to look after the pack-horse till somebody can take
it back to the ranch-house. Where do we hit this
trail you were telling me about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About a mile and a half further on. It ain&#8217;t much
to boast of, but chances are we won&#8217;t meet up with a
soul till we run into the main road a mile or so this
side of Perilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud&#8217;s prediction proved accurate. They encountered
no one throughout the entire length of the twisting,
narrow, little-used trail, and even when they
reached the main road early in the afternoon there was
very little passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon they&#8217;re all taking their siesta,&#8221; commented.
Bud. &#8220;Perilla&#8217;s a great place for greasers, yuh know,
bein&#8217; so near the border. There&#8217;s a heap sight more
of &#8217;em than whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently they began to pass small, detached adobe
huts, some of them the merest hovels. A few dark-faced
children were in sight here and there, but the
older persons were all evidently comfortably indoors,
slumbering through the noonday heat.</p>
<p>Further on the houses were closer together, and at
length Bud announced that they were nearing the main
street, one end of which crossed the road they were
on at right angles.</p>
<p>&#8220;That rickety old shack there is just on the corner,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
he explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s a Mexican eating-house, as I
remember. Most of the stores an&#8217; decent places are
up further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder where Hardenberg hangs out?&#8221; remarked
Stratton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh got me. I never had no professional use
for him before. Reckon most anybody can tell us,
though. That looks like a cow-man over there.
Let&#8217;s ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment or two later they stopped before the
dingy, weather-beaten building on the corner. Two
horses fretted at the hitching-rack, and on the steps
lounged a man in regulation cow-boy garb. A cigarette
dangled from one corner of his mouth, and as
the two halted he glanced up from the newspaper he
was reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardenberg?&#8221; he repeated in answer to the question.
&#8220;Yuh mean the sheriff? Why, he&#8217;s inside
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud looked surprised and somewhat incredulous.
&#8220;What the devil&#8217;s he doin&#8217; in that greaser eatin&#8217;-house?&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger squinted one eye as the cigarette smoke
curled up into his face. &#8220;Oh, he ain&#8217;t patronizin&#8217; the
joint,&#8221; he explained with a touch of dry amusement.
&#8220;He&#8217;s after old José Maria for sellin&#8217; licker, I reckon.
Him an&#8217; one of his deputies rode up about five minutes
ago.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>After a momentary hesitation Stratton and Jessup
dismounted and tied their horses to the rack. Buck
realized that the sheriff might not care to be interrupted
while on business of this sort, but their own
case was so urgent that he decided to take a chance.
At least he could find out when Hardenberg would be
at leisure.</p>
<p>Pushing through the swinging door, they found
themselves in a single, long room, excessively dingy
and rather dark, the only light coming from two unshuttered
windows on the north side. To Buck&#8217;s surprise
at least a score of Mexicans were seated around
five or six bare wooden tables eating and drinking.
Certainly if a raid was on they were taking it very
calmly. The next moment he was struck by two
things; the sudden hush which greeted their appearance,
and the absence of any one who could possibly
be the man they sought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like that fellow must have given us the
wrong tip,&#8221; he said, glancing at Jessup. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
any one here who&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused as a wizened, middle-aged Mexican got
up from the other end of the room and came toward
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo&#8217; wish zee table, señors?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;P&#8217;raps
like zee <i>chile con carne</i>, or zee&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want anything to eat,&#8221; interrupted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
Stratton. &#8220;I understand Sheriff Hardenberg is here.
Could I see him a minute?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, zee shereef!&#8221; shrugged the Mexican, with a
characteristic gesture of his hands. &#8220;He in zee
back room with José Maria. Yo&#8217; please come zis
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and walked toward a door at the further
end of the long room, the two men following him between
the tables. But Buck had not taken more than
half a dozen steps before he stopped abruptly. That
curious silence seemed to him too long continued to be
natural; there was a hint of tension, of suspense in it.
And something about the attitude of the seated Mexicans&mdash;a
vague sense of watchful, stealthy scrutiny,
of tense, quivering muscles&mdash;confirmed his sudden
suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold up, Bud!&#8221; he warned impulsively. &#8220;There&#8217;s
something wrong here.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if the words were a signal, the crowd about them
surged up suddenly, with the harsh scrape of many
chair-legs and an odd, sibilant sound, caused by a multitude
of quick-drawn breaths. Like a flash Buck
pulled his gun and leveled it on the nearest greaser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of the way,&#8221; he ordered, taking a step toward
the outer door.</p>
<p>The fellow shrank back instinctively, but to Buck&#8217;s
surprise&mdash;the average Mexican is not noted for daredevil
bravery&mdash;several others behind pushed themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
forward. Suddenly Jessup&#8217;s voice rose in shrill
warning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out, Buck! Behind yuh&mdash;quick! That
guy&#8217;s got a knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton whirled swiftly to catch a flashing vision
of a tall Mexican creeping toward him, a long, slim
knife glittering in his upraised hand. The fellow was
so close that another step would bring him within
striking distance, and without hesitation Buck&#8217;s finger
pressed the trigger.</p>
<p>The hammer fell with an ominous, metallic click.
Amazed, Buck hastily pulled the trigger twice again
without results. As he realized that in some mysterious
manner the weapon had been tampered with, his
teeth grated, but with no perceptible pause in the swiftness
of his action he drew back his arm and hurled
the pistol straight into the greaser&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>His aim was deadly. The heavy Colt struck the fellow
square on the mouth, and with a smothered cry he
dropped the knife and staggered back, flinging up both
hands to his face. But others leaped forward to take
his place, a dozen knives flashing in as many hands.
The ring closed swiftly, and from behind him Stratton
heard Bud cry out with an oath that his gun was useless.</p>
<p>There was no time for conscious planning. It was
instinct alone&mdash;that primitive instinct of every man
sore pressed to get his back against something solid&mdash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
made Buck lunge forward suddenly, seize a Mexican
around the waist, and hurl him bodily at one side
of the closing circle.</p>
<p>This parted abruptly and two men went sprawling.
One of them Buck kicked out of the way, feeling a
savage satisfaction at the impact of his boot against
soft flesh and at the yell of pain that followed. Catching
Jessup by an arm he swept him toward one of the
tables, snatched up a chair, and with his back against
the heavy piece of furniture he faced the mob. His
hat was gone, and as he stood there, big body braced,
mouth set, and hair crested above his smoldering eyes,
he made a splendid picture of force and strength which
seemed for an instant to awe the Mexicans into inactivity.</p>
<p>But the pause was momentary. Urged on by a
voice in the rear, they surged forward again, two of
the foremost hurling their knives with deadly aim.
One Stratton avoided by a swift duck of his head; the
other he caught dexterously on the chair-bottom.
Then, over the heads of the crowd, another chair came
hurtling with unexpected force and precision. It
struck Buck&#8217;s crude weapon squarely, splintering the
legs and leaving him only the back and precariously
wobbling seat.</p>
<p>He flung this at one of the advancing men and
floored him. But another, slipping agilely in from the
side, rushed at him with upraised knife. He was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
same greaser who, weeks before, had played that trick
about the letter; and Buck&#8217;s lips twitched grimly as he
recognized him.</p>
<p>As the knife flashed downward, Stratton squirmed
his body sidewise so that the blade merely grazed
one shoulder. Grasping the slim wrist, he twisted
it with brutal force, and the weapon clattered to the
floor. An instant later he had gripped the fellow
about the body and, exerting all his strength, hurled
him across the table and straight through the near-by
window.</p>
<p>The sound of a shrill scream and the crash of shattered
glass came simultaneously. In the momentary,
dead silence that followed, one could have almost heard
a pin drop.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>SHERIFF HARDENBERG INTERVENES</h3>
</div>

<p>During that brief lull Buck found time to wonder
why no one had sense enough to use a gun
to bring them down. But almost as swiftly the answer
came to him; they dared not risk the sound of
a shot bringing interference from without. He
flashed a glance at Bud, who sagged panting against
the table, the fragments of a chair in his hands and
a trickle of blood running down his face. Somehow
the sight of that blood turned Buck into a raging
savage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, you damned coyotes!&#8221; he snarled.
&#8220;Come and get yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a brief space it looked as if no one had nerve
enough to accept his challenge, and Buck shot a sudden
appraising glance toward the outer door, between
which and them their assailants crowded thickest. But
before he could plan a way to rush the throng, that
same sharp voice sounded from the rear which before
had stirred the greasers into action, and six or seven
of them began to creep warily forward. Their movements
were plainly reluctant, however, and of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
sudden Stratton gave a spring which carried him within
reaching distance of the two foremost. Gripping
each by a collar, he cracked their heads together thrice
in swift succession, hurled their limp bodies from him,
grabbed another chair from the floor, and was back
beside Jessup before any of their startled companions
had time to stir.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s the time to rush &#8217;em, kid,&#8221; he panted in
Jessup&#8217;s ear. &#8220;When I give the word&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly as the front door was flung
suddenly open and a sharp, incisive, dominant voice
rang through the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in hell &#8217;s doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a fraction of a second the silence was intense.
Then like a flash a man leaped up and flung himself
through the window, while three others plunged out of
the rear door and disappeared. Others were crowding
after them when there came a sudden spurt of
flame, the sharp sound of a pistol-shot, and a bullet
buried itself in the casing of the rear door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand still, every damn&#8217; one of you,&#8221; ordered the
new-comer.</p>
<p>He strode down the room through the light powder-haze
and paused before Stratton, tall, wide-shouldered,
and lean of flank, with a thin, hawklike face and
penetrating gray eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he questioned curtly. &#8220;What&#8217;s it all
about? That scoundrel been selling licker again?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not to us,&#8221; snapped Buck. &#8220;Are you Hardenberg?&#8221;
he added, with sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re the cause of our being in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gray eyes studied him narrowly. &#8220;How
come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to town to see you specially and was told
by a man outside that you were making a raid on this
joint. We hadn&#8217;t been inside three minutes before
we found it was a plant to get us here and knife us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get you,&#8221; remarked the sheriff in a slightly
puzzled tone.</p>
<p>By this time Buck&#8217;s momentary irritation at the hint
that it was all merely a drunken quarrel was dying
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; he returned in a more amiable
tone. &#8220;It&#8217;s a long story&mdash;too long to tell just now.
I can only say that we were attacked without cause
by the whole gang here, and if you hadn&#8217;t shown up
just now, it&#8217;s a question whether we&#8217;d have gotten
away alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff&#8217;s glance swept over the disordered room,
taking in the shattered window, the bodies on the
floor, the Mexican who crouched moaning in a corner,
and returned to Stratton&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about that last,&#8221; he commented,
with a momentary grim smile. &#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck Green.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! You wrote me a letter&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;ll explain about that later. Meanwhile&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off and, bending swiftly, pulled his Colt
from under the table. Breaking the weapon, he ejected
a little shower of empty brass shells, at the sight of
which his lips tightened. Still without comment, he
rapidly filled it from his belt, Hardenberg watching
him intently the while.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, you&#8217;d like a little action, eh?&#8221; drawled
the sheriff. &#8220;You&#8217;re right. Either of you hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced inquiringly at Jessup, who was just wiping
the blood from his cut face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not me,&#8221; snapped Bud. &#8220;This don&#8217;t amount to
nothin&#8217;. Say, was there a guy hangin&#8217; around outside
when yuh came in&mdash;short, with black hair an&#8217;
eyes set close together?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck gave a slight start; the sheriff shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have known he&#8217;d beat it,&#8221; snorted Bud.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll get the lyin&#8217; son-of-a-gun yet; it was him
told us yuh were in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardenberg&#8217;s gray eyes narrowed slightly. &#8220;That&#8217;ll
come later. We&#8217;ll round up this bunch first. If you
two will ride around to Main Street and get hold of
half a dozen of my deputies, I&#8217;ll stay here and hold this
bunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rapidly he mentioned the names of the men he
wanted and where they could be found, and Stratton
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
and Jessup hastily departed. Outside they found three
horses, their own, tied to the hitching-rack as they
had left them, and a big, powerful black, who stood
squarely facing the door, reins merely trailing and
ears pricked forward. The two that had been there
when they first rode up were gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like I thought,&#8221; said Jessup, as they mounted
and swung around the corner. &#8220;That guy was planted
there a-purpose to get us into the eatin&#8217;-house. What&#8217;s
more, I&#8217;ll bet my saddle he was the same one who
came snoopin&#8217; around Red Butte camp two weeks ago.
Recollect, Gabby said he was small, with black hair
an&#8217; eyes close together?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck nodded. &#8220;It&#8217;s a mighty sure thing he was
there again last night and pulled our loads,&#8221; he added
in a tone of chagrin. &#8220;We&#8217;re a pretty dumb pair,
kid. Next time we&#8217;ll believe Gabby when he says his
door was opened in the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say so. But I thought the old bird was just
fussing. Never even looked at my gun. But why
the devil should we have suspected anythin&#8217;? Why,
Lynch don&#8217;t even know yore alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have found out someway,&#8221; shrugged
Stratton, &#8220;though I can&#8217;t imagine how. No use shedding
tears over it, though. What we&#8217;ve got to do is
get Hardenberg moving double-quick. Here&#8217;s George
Harley; I&#8217;ll take him, and you go on to the next one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rapidly the deputies were gathered together and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
hurried back to the eating-house to find Hardenberg
holding the Mexicans without difficulty. Half an
hour later these were safely lodged in the jail, and the
sheriff began a rigorous examination, which lasted
until late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The boldness of the affair angered him and made
him determined to get at the bottom of it; but this
proved no easy matter. To begin with, José Maria,
the proprietor of the restaurant, was missing. Either
he had merely rented his place to the instigator of the
plot, and was prudently absenting himself for a while,
or else he was one of those who had escaped through
the rear door. Most of the Mexicans were natives of
Perilla, and one and all swore that they were as innocent
of evil intent as unborn children. They had
merely happened to be there getting a meal when the
fracas started. The miscreants who had drawn knives
on the two whites were quite unknown to them, and
must be the ones who had escaped.</p>
<p>Hardenberg knew perfectly well that they were
lying, but for the moment he let it pass. He had an
idea that Stratton could throw some light on the situation,
and leaving the prisoners to digest a few pithy
truths, he took the cow-puncher into his private room
to hear his story.</p>
<p>Though Buck tried to make this as brief as possible,
it took some time, especially as the sheriff showed an
absorbing interest from the start and persisted in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
asking frequent questions and requesting fuller details.
When he had finally heard everything, he leaned back
in his chair, regarding Stratton thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty interesting dope,&#8221; he remarked, lighting
a cigarette. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had my eyes on Tex Lynch for
some time, but I had no idea he was up to anything
like this. You&#8217;re dead sure about that oil?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck nodded. &#8220;Of course, you can&#8217;t ever be certain
about the quantity until you bore, but I went over
some of the Oklahoma fields a few years ago, and this
sure looks like something big.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty soft for the lady,&#8221; commented Hardenberg.
He paused, regarding Stratton curiously. &#8220;Just
whereabouts do you come off?&#8221; he asked frankly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering about that all along, and you
can see I&#8217;ve got to be dead sure of my facts before I
get busy on this seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Buck had been expecting the question, he
hesitated for an instant before replying.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; he replied slowly at length, &#8220;but for
the present I&#8217;d like to have you keep it under your hat.
My name isn&#8217;t Green at all, but&mdash;Stratton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stratton?&#8221; repeated the sheriff in a puzzled tone.
&#8220;Stratton?&#8221; A sudden look of incredulity flashed
into his eyes. &#8220;You&#8217;re not trying to make out that
you&#8217;re the Buck Stratton who owned the Shoe-Bar?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck flushed a little. &#8220;I was afraid you&#8217;d find it
hard to swallow, but it&#8217;s true,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
see, the papers got it wrong. I wasn&#8217;t killed at all,
but only wounded in the head. For&mdash;for over a year
I hadn&#8217;t any memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Briefly he narrated the circumstances of the unusual
case, and Hardenberg listened with absorbed attention,
watching him closely, weighing every word, and
noting critically the most trifling gesture or change
of expression. For a while his natural skepticism
struggled with a growing conviction that the man before
him was telling the truth. It was an extraordinary
experience, to be sure, but he quickly realized
that Stratton had nothing to gain by a deliberate imposture.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can prove all that, of course?&#8221; he asked when
Buck had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I haven&#8217;t any close relatives, but
there are plenty of men who&#8217;ll swear to my identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff sat silent for a moment. &#8220;Some experience,&#8221;
he mused presently. &#8220;Rotten hard luck, too,
I&#8217;ll say. Of course you never had a suspicion of oil
when you sold the outfit to old man Thorne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Buck hesitated. Somehow he found this part
of the affair extraordinarily hard to put into words.
But he knew that it must be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t sell it,&#8221; he said curtly at length. &#8220;That
transfer of Thorne&#8217;s was a forgery. He was a man
I&#8217;d had a number of business dealings with, and when
I went to France I left all my papers in his charge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
I suppose when he saw my name on the list of missing,
he thought he could take a chance. But his daughter
knew nothing whatever about it. She&#8217;s white all
through and thinks the ranch is honestly hers. That&#8217;s
the reason why I want you to keep quiet about this
for a while. You can see how she&#8217;d feel if this came
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint, fleeting smile curved the corners of Jim
Hardenberg&#8217;s straight mouth. Accustomed by his
profession to think the worst of people, and to probe
deeply and callously for hidden evil motives, it amused
and rather pleased him to meet a man whose extraordinary
story roused not the faintest doubt in his
critical mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some dirty business,&#8221; he commented at length.
&#8220;Still, it&#8217;s come out all right, and at that you&#8217;re
ahead of the game. That oil might have laid there
for years without your getting wise to it. Well, let&#8217;s
get down to cases. It&#8217;s going to take some planning
to get that scoundrel Lynch, to say nothing of the men
higher up. Tell me about those fellows in the car
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck readily went over that part of his story, describing
the fat man and his driver as accurately as he
was able. The sheriff&#8217;s eyes narrowed thoughtfully
as he listened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you know him?&#8221; Buck asked curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. Description sounds a bit familiar,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
but descriptions are apt to fool you. I wish you&#8217;d
managed to get the number of the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would likely be a fake one,&#8221; Stratton reminded
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe. Well, I&#8217;ll make a few inquiries.&#8221; He
stood up stretching. &#8220;I&#8217;d like mighty well to start
for the Shoe-Bar to-night, but I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t get
a posse together soon enough. We&#8217;ll need some
bunch to round up that gang. You&#8217;ll be at the United
States Hotel, I suppose? Well, I&#8217;ll get busy now,
and after supper I&#8217;ll drop around to let you know how
things are going. With what you&#8217;ve told me I&#8217;ll see
if I can&#8217;t squeeze some information out of those
greasers. It may help.&#8221;</p>
<p>They left the room together, the sheriff pausing
outside to give some instructions to his assistant.
Buck gathered in Jessup, who had been waiting, and
the two left the building and walked toward the hotel,
where they had left their horses.</p>
<p>Perilla was a town of some size, and at this hour
the main street was fairly well crowded with a picturesque
throng of cowboys, Mexicans, and Indians
from the near-by reservation, with the usual mingling
of more prosaic-looking business men. Not a few
motor-cars mingled with horsemen and wagons of
various sorts in the roadway, but as Buck&#8217;s glance fell
on a big, shiny, black touring-car standing at the curb,
he was struck by a sudden feeling of familiarity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>Mechanically he noted the license-number. Then
his eyes narrowed as he saw the pudgy, heavily-built
figure in the tan dust-coat on the point of descending
from the tonneau.</p>
<p>An instant later they were face to face. For a
second the fat man glanced at him indifferently with
that same pouting droop to the small lips which Stratton
knew he never could forget. Then, like a flash,
the round eyes widened and filled with horror, the jaw
dropped, the fat face turned to a pale, sickly green.
A choking gurgle burst from the man&#8217;s lips, and he
seemed on the point of collapse when a hand reached
out and dragged him back into the car, which, at a
hasty word from the occupant of the back seat, shot
from the curb and hummed rapidly away.</p>
<p>Thinking to stop them by shooting up the tires.
Buck&#8217;s hand dropped instinctively to his gun. But he
realized in time that such drastic methods were neither
expedient nor necessary. Instead, he turned and halted
a man of about forty who was passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any idea who that fellow is?&#8221; he asked, motioning
toward the car, just whirling around the next corner.
&#8220;He&#8217;s short and fat, in a big black Hammond
car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Short and fat in a Hammond car?&#8221; repeated the
man, staring down the street. &#8220;Hum! Must be Paul
Draper from Amarillo. He&#8217;s the only one I know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
around these parts who owns a Hammond. Come to
think, though, his car is gray.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s probably had it painted lately,&#8221; suggested
Stratton quietly. &#8220;Much obliged. I thought I&#8217;d seen
him before some place.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>AN HOUR TOO LATE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I had an idea that&#8217;s who it was when you described
him,&#8221; said Sheriff Hardenberg, to whom
Stratton returned at once with the news. &#8220;There&#8217;s
only one &#8216;Paul&#8217; around here who fits the bill, and he
sure does to perfection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; asked Buck curiously.</p>
<p>Hardenberg&#8217;s eyes narrowed. &#8220;The slickest piece
of goods in the State of Arizona, I&#8217;d say. He&#8217;s been
mixed up in more crooked deals than any man I ever
ran up against; but he&#8217;s so gol-darn cute nobody&#8217;s
ever been able to catch him with the goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure don&#8217;t look it,&#8221; commented Stratton.
&#8220;With that baby stare of his and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; interrupted the sheriff. &#8220;That&#8217;s part of
his stock in trade; it&#8217;s pulled many a sucker. He&#8217;s
got a mighty convincing way about him, believe me!
He can tell the damnedest bunch of lies, looking you
straight in the eyes all the time, till you&#8217;d swear everything
he said was gospel. But his big specialty is egging
somebody else on to do the dirty work, and when
the dangerous part is over, he steps in and hogs most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
of the profits. He&#8217;s organized fake mining companies
and stock companies. Last year he got up a big
cattle-raising combine, persuaded three or four men
over in the next county to pool their outfits, and issued
stock for about three times what it was worth. It
busted up, of course, but not before he&#8217;d sold a big
block to some Eastern suckers and got away with the
proceeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d think that would have been enough to land
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; returned Hardenberg
with a shrug. &#8220;But the law&#8217;s a tricky business sometimes,
and he managed to shave the line just close
enough to be safe. Well, it looks as if we had a
chance of bagging him at last,&#8221; he added in a tone of
heartfelt satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to arrest him before we start for the Shoe-Bar?&#8221;
asked Buck.</p>
<p>Hardenberg laughed shortly. &#8220;Hell, no! You
don&#8217;t know Paul Draper if you think he could be convicted
on your statement, unsupported by witnesses.
Believe me, by this time he&#8217;s doped out an iron-clad
alibi, or something, and we wouldn&#8217;t have a chance.
But if one of the Shoe-Bar gang should turn State&#8217;s
evidence, that&#8217;s another matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid he may beat it if you let him
go that long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to that. One of my men will start for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
Amarillo right away and keep him in sight till we come
back. By the way, we&#8217;ve got José Maria, and that
guy you fired through the window. Caught the old
fox sneaking back of those shacks along the north
road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to warn Lynch, I reckon,&#8221; suggested Buck
crisply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought, so I strung some men
along at likely points to pick up any more that may
try the same trick. I haven&#8217;t got anything out of
José yet, but a little thumbscrewing may produce
results. I&#8217;ll tell you about it to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was late when he finally appeared at the hotel
lobby, and he had no very favorable news to impart.
José Maria, it appeared, had stuck to the story of being
engaged by an alleged Federal official to apprehend
two outlaws, whose descriptions fitted Buck and his
companion perfectly. He admitted having engaged
the other Mexicans to help him, but swore that he had
never intended any harm to the two men. Their instructions
were merely to capture and hold them until
the arrival of the supposed official.</p>
<p>&#8220;All rot, of course,&#8221; Hardenberg stated in conclusion.
&#8220;But it hangs together a bit too well for any
greaser to have thought out by himself. I reckon that
cow-man who got you into the joint was responsible
for the yarn and told José to give it out in case things
should go wrong. Well, I won&#8217;t waste any more time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
on the bunch. You two be around about seven to-morrow.
I&#8217;d like to start sooner, but some of the
boys have to come in from a distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck and Jessup were there ahead of time, but it
was more than an hour later when the posse left Perilla.
There were about twenty men in all, for Hardenberg
planned to send a portion of them across country
to guard the outlet of that secret trail through the
mountains of which Buck had told him. If Lynch
and his men had any warning of their coming, or happened
to be out on the range, the chances were all in
favor of their making for the mountains and trying
to escape by the cattle rustlers&#8217; route.</p>
<p>During the ride the thought of Mary Thorne was
often in Buck&#8217;s mind. He did not fear for her personal
safety. Alf Manning was there, and though
Stratton did not like him he had never doubted the fellow&#8217;s
courage or his ability to act as a protector to the
three women, should the need arise. But that such a
need would arise seemed most unlikely, for Lynch had
nothing to gain by treating the girl save with respect
and consideration. He had no compunction about
robbing her, but she could scarcely be expected to enter
further into his schemes and calculations, especially
at a time when his whole mind must be a turmoil of
doubt and fear and uncertainty as to the future.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Buck wished more than once that he
had been able to get in touch with her since that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
memorable afternoon when he had watched her ride
out of sight down the little cañon, if only to prepare
her for what was going on. It must have been very
hard for her to go about day after day, knowing nothing,
suspecting a thousand things, fretting, worrying,
with not a soul to confide in, yet forced continually
to present an untroubled countenance to those
about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank the Lord it&#8217;ll soon be over and she&#8217;ll be relieved,&#8221;
he thought, when they finally came in sight of
the ranch-house.</p>
<p>As the posse swept through the lower gate and up
the slope, Buck&#8217;s eyes searched the building keenly.
Not a soul was in sight, either there or about the corrals.
He had seen it thus apparently deserted more
than once before, and told himself now that his uneasiness
was absurd. But when the girl suddenly
appeared on the veranda and stood staring at the
approaching horsemen, Buck&#8217;s heart leaped with a sudden
spasm of intense relief, and unconsciously he
spurred his horse ahead of the others.</p>
<p>As he swung himself out of the saddle, she came
swiftly forward, her face glowing with surprise and
pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;ve come,&#8221; she said in a low,
quick voice, clasping his outstretched hand. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
been worrying&mdash;You&mdash;you&#8217;re quite all right now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fine and dandy,&#8221; Buck assured her. &#8220;Thanks to
you, and Bud, I&#8217;m perfectly whole again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She greeted Jessup, who came up smiling, and then
Sheriff Hardenberg was presented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very glad to meet you, Miss Thorne,&#8221; he said.
There was a faint twinkle in his eyes as he glanced
toward Stratton for an instant, his belief confirmed
as to the principal reason for Buck&#8217;s desire to keep
the secret of the Shoe-Bar ownership. Then he became
businesslike.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Lynch and the rest of &#8217;em?&#8221; he asked
briskly.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face grew suddenly serious. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know,&#8221; she answered quickly. &#8220;They were all working
about the barns until a strange cow-boy rode in
about two hours ago. I saw him pass the window
but didn&#8217;t think much about it. About half an hour
or so later I went out to give some orders to Pedro;
he&#8217;s the cook, you know. But he wasn&#8217;t there and
neither was Maria, and when I went out to the barns
the men were gone. Of course something urgent
might easily have taken them out on the range, but
neither Maria nor Pedro has been off the place for
weeks. Besides, when I peeped into the bunk-house
everything was tossed about in confusion, as if&mdash;Well,
I was afraid something&mdash;had happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has,&#8221; stated the sheriff grimly. &#8220;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
truth is, that scoundrel Lynch has got to the end
of his rope, and we&#8217;re after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face paled, then flushed deeply. &#8220;What&mdash;what
is it?&#8221; she asked in a low, troubled voice.
&#8220;What has he&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather a long story, and I&#8217;m afraid there isn&#8217;t
time to stop and tell you now,&#8221; explained the sheriff as
she paused. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to make every minute count.
You have no idea which way they went?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been west or south,&#8221; the girl answered
promptly. &#8220;If they&#8217;d gone any other way I
should have seen them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Hardenberg, wheeling his horse.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about anything,&#8221; he added over one
shoulder. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be back in a jiffy.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he and his men spurred down the slope toward
the entrance to middle pasture, the girl&#8217;s eyes sought
Stratton&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must.&#8221; He quickly answered her unspoken
question. &#8220;They&#8217;ll need us to show them the way.
We&#8217;ll be back, though, as soon as we possibly can.
You&#8217;re not nervous, are you? You&#8217;re perfectly safe,
of course, with&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she assured him promptly. &#8220;Lynch
has gone. There&#8217;ll be nothing for us to worry about
here. Good-by, then, for a while. And do be careful&mdash;both
of you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>Her face was a trifle pale, and about her mouth and
chin were traced a few faint lines which hinted vaguely
of forced composure. As Buck hastened to overtake
the posse, he recalled her expression, and
wondered with a troubled qualm whether she wasn&#8217;t
really more nervous than she let herself appear. Perhaps
she might have been more comfortable if he or
Bud had remained at the ranch-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably it&#8217;s all my imagination,&#8221; he decided at
length. &#8220;With Manning there, she&#8217;s perfectly safe,
especially as we&#8217;ve got the whole gang on the run.
The ranch-house would be the very last place they&#8217;d
head for.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>FOREBODINGS</h3>
</div>

<p>Almost at once they struck a fresh trail, made
by a number of horsemen riding in a bunch,
which led diagonally across middle pasture. It was
easy to follow, and Hardenberg pushed his men hard
to make up for delays which were likely to come later
on. For a time Buck rode beside the sheriff, discussing
their plans and explaining the lay of the land.
Then he fell back a little to chat with Jessup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure glad of one thing,&#8221; Bud said emphatically,
after a few desultory remarks. &#8220;Miss Mary
won&#8217;t be bothered no more now with that son-of-a-gun
hangin&#8217; around an&#8217; makin&#8217; eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton turned on him suddenly. &#8220;Who the devil
do you mean?&#8221; he demanded sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Tex, of course,&#8221; shrugged Jessup. &#8220;He
used to put in considerable time soft-soapin&#8217; around
her. A hell of a nerve, I&#8217;ll say, makin&#8217; up to such
as her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck scowled. &#8220;I never saw anything like that,&#8221;
he said brusquely, &#8220;except maybe once,&#8221; he added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
With a sudden recollection of that afternoon they
moved the herd out of south pasture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely not,&#8221; returned Bud. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t so bad
till after yuh went. I got the notion he took to
courtin&#8217; her, yuh might say, as a kind of last hope.
If he could figger on gettin&#8217; her to marry him, he&#8217;d
have the ranch an&#8217; everythin&#8217; on it without no more
trouble at all. You&#8217;d think even a scoundrel like him
would see she wouldn&#8217;t look at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he&mdash; Was he&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Nothin&#8217; raw a-tall,&#8221; returned Bud, divining
the thought in Stratton&#8217;s mind. &#8220;He just hung
around the ranch-house a lot, an&#8217; was awful sweet,
an&#8217; used them black eyes of his consid&#8217;able. Sorta
preparing the way, I reckon. But he didn&#8217;t get far.&#8221;
He chuckled reminiscently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell the world, she
didn&#8217;t waste no time sendin&#8217; him about his business.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a time Buck rode on in frowning silence. The
very thought enraged him and added deeply to
the score that was piling up so rapidly against the
scoundrel.</p>
<p>Presently Bud&#8217;s voice broke in upon his savage
reverie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny we didn&#8217;t see nothin&#8217; of the Mannings back
there,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;The lady couldn&#8217;t of known
yuh was around.&#8221; He glanced slyly at Buck. &#8220;Besides,&#8221;
he added, seeing that his friend&#8217;s expression
did not lighten, &#8220;with somethin&#8217; like this doin&#8217;, you&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
think his lordship would want to strut around in
them baggy pants an&#8217; yellow boots, an&#8217; air his views
on how to go about to catch the gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton turned his head abruptly. &#8220;But they must
be there!&#8221; he said sharply. &#8220;They surely can&#8217;t have
gone away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t no talk of it when I left,&#8221; shrugged
Bud. &#8220;Still, an&#8217; all, me an&#8217; his nibs wasn&#8217;t on exactly
confidential terms, an&#8217; he might have forgot to tell
me about his plans. Yuh got to remember, too, I&#8217;ve
been gone over a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>A worried wrinkle dodged into Buck&#8217;s forehead.
All along he had taken the presence of the Mannings
so entirely for granted that the possibility of their
having left the ranch never once occurred to him.
But now, in a flash, he realized that by this time, for
all he knew, they might be back in Chicago. As Bud
said, it certainly seemed odd that neither of them had
appeared when the posse rode up to the ranch-house.
What a fool he had been not to make sure about it.
Why hadn&#8217;t he asked the question outright?</p>
<p>&#8220;But I did mention it while we were talking,&#8221; he
thought, trying to reconstruct that brief interview with
Mary Thorne. &#8220;Hang it all! No, I didn&#8217;t. I was
going to, but she interrupted. But she must have
known what I referred to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly there came back the vivid recollection of
the girl&#8217;s face as she said good-by. Outwardly cheerful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
and composed, that faint pallor and the few lines of
strain etched about her mouth and chin struck him
now with a tremendous significance. She had known
what was in his mind, but purposely refrained from
revealing the truth for fear of becoming a drag and
hamper to him. She was game through and through.</p>
<p>The realization brought a wave of tenderness surging
over the man, followed swiftly by a deepening
sense of trouble and uneasiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it at all, Bud,&#8221; he burst out abruptly.
&#8220;I wish to thunder we&#8217;d found out for sure about
those Mannings. If they have gone, one of us at least
ought to have stayed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course I&#8217;m only guessin&#8217;. Quite likely
they&#8217;re there yet, only it just seemed funny not to
see them. But even if she is left alone with only
Mrs. Archer, yuh ain&#8217;t worryin&#8217; about anythin&#8217; really
happenin&#8217; to her, are yuh? It&#8217;ll be darn lonesome,
an&#8217; all that, but Lynch an&#8217; the whole gang has beat
it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we know where they have gone?&#8221; cut in
Stratton curtly. &#8220;They had a good hour&#8217;s start, and
more. It&#8217;ll be getting dusk pretty quick. What&#8217;s to
prevent one or more of &#8217;em circling back by the southeast?
Lynch is capable of anything, and after what
you&#8217;ve just told me&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;But what would he have to
gain&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gain?&#8221; repeated Buck irritably. &#8220;How the devil
do I know what&#8217;s in that polecat&#8217;s mind? He&#8217;s quite
capable of hiding behind a woman&#8217;s skirts. He&#8217;s even
capable of carrying her off and trying to force her to
marry him, or something like that. I&#8217;ve half a mind
to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off, frowning. Bud, now thoroughly
alarmed, stared at him uneasily. &#8220;You&#8217;d better let
me go back,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;They&#8217;ll need yuh
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t give a damn whether they need me or not,&#8221;
retorted Buck swiftly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a better idea,
though. We&#8217;ll hit Las Vegas inside of ten minutes.
The &#8217;phone&#8217;s still working, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the last I knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a chance. There&#8217;s been nothing to put
it out of business. By calling up we&#8217;ll know how
things stand a whole lot quicker. If she and Mrs.
Archer are alone, I&#8217;ll chase back at once and you can
show Hardenberg the way into the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Bud&#8217;s face showed no particular pleasure
in the plan, he made no comment, and they rode on in
silence. Presently the sheriff turned and called to
Stratton. The trail was spreading out, he said, and
growing more and more difficult to follow in the waning
light.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why they rode so far apart,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
he said, &#8220;unless it was to make it hard for any one to
track them. Looks to me, though, as if they were
heading straight for that cut into the mountains you
told me about. Is it much further off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About a quarter of a mile below the little &#8217;dobe
shack we&#8217;re coming to,&#8221; Stratton answered. &#8220;The
creek takes a sharp turn to the southeast, and right at
the bend you cross and ride straight west into a narrow
draw that doesn&#8217;t look like it went anywhere.
Further on it twists around and leads into a short
cañon that brings you through to a sort of valley lying
between the hills. After that everything&#8217;s plain
sailing. It&#8217;s almost as plain as a regular trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; nodded Hardenberg. &#8220;Anything to mark
the draw?&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck thought a minute. &#8220;As I remember, there&#8217;s
a low ridge on the north side, and a big clump of
mesquite on the right just before you leave the
flats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll be with us to act as guide. I wish
we&#8217;d had an hour&#8217;s earlier start, though. It won&#8217;t be
any cinch traveling through these mountains in the
dark. Still, at the worst, we can count on Dick Jordan&#8217;s
bunch to nab them as they come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I can stick along with
you much longer,&#8221; he added briefly. &#8220;But Jessup can
show you the way quite as well. There seems to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
some doubt now about those people I spoke of being
still at the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! That would mean that Miss Thorne
would be there alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, except for her aunt. I may be worrying unnecessarily,
but with a scoundrel like Lynch&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never can tell,&#8221; finished the sheriff as he hesitated.
&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough. We mustn&#8217;t take any
chances. But how&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Telephone. There&#8217;s a line from the ranch-house
to Las Vegas camp just ahead.&#8221; Buck pointed where,
through the gathering dusk, the outlines of the adobe
shack showed dimly. &#8220;If I find there&#8217;s no one with
her, I&#8217;ll ride back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it,&#8221; nodded the sheriff. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t show
up I&#8217;ll understand. At a pinch I reckon we could
find the trail ourselves from your directions.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Stratton pulled off to the right, he waved his
hand and swept onward with the posse. Buck reached
the door and swung out of the saddle, flinging the
reins over Pete&#8217;s head. Then he found that Bud had
followed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to wait an&#8217; hear what yuh find out,&#8221; the
youngster stated resolutely. &#8220;I can catch up with &#8217;em
easy enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck hastily entered the shack, which was almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
pitch-dark. A faint glint of metal came from the
telephone, hanging beside one window; and as he
swiftly crossed the room and fumbled for the bell,
there stirred within him a sudden sense of apprehension
that was almost dread.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>CREEPING SHADOWS</h3>
</div>

<p>With her back against the veranda pillar, Mary
Thorne watched the group of mounted men
canter down the slope, splash across the creek, and
file briskly through the gate leading to middle pasture.
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that,
for the most part, her glance followed one of them,
and when the erect, jaunty, broad-shouldered figure
on the big roan had disappeared, she gave a little sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks better&mdash;much better,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>Her eyes grew dreamy, and in her mind she saw
again that little hidden cañon with its overhanging
ledge beneath which the man lay stretched out on his
blankets. Somehow, the anxiety and suspense, the
heart-breaking worry and weariness of that strange
experience had faded utterly. There remained only a
very vivid recollection of the touch of her hand against
his damp forehead, the feeling of his crisp, dark hair
as she pushed it gently back, the look of those long,
thick lashes lying so still against his pallid face.</p>
<p>Not seldom she had wished those fleeting moments
might have been prolonged. Once or twice she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
even a little jealous of Bud Jessup&#8217;s ministrations;
just as, thinking of him now, she was jealous of his
constant nearness to Buck and the manner in which
he seemed so intently to share all the other&#8217;s plans and
projects, and even thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway,&#8221; she said suddenly aloud, &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad Stella&#8217;s not here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, realizing that she had spoken aloud, she
blushed and looked hastily around. No one was in
sight, but a moment or two later Mrs. Archer appeared
on the veranda.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I heard voices a little while ago,&#8221;
she said, glancing around. &#8220;Have the men come
back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary turned to meet her. &#8220;No, dear. That was
the&mdash;the sheriff and some of his men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheriff!&#8221; An expression of anxiety came into
Mrs. Archer&#8217;s pretty, faded face. &#8220;But what has
happened? What&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure; they had no time to explain.&#8221;
The girl put an arm reassuringly around the older
woman&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;But they&#8217;re after Tex and the
other hands. They&#8217;ve done something&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; In any other person the sound would have
seemed suspiciously like a crow of undisguised satisfaction.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m thankful that at last somebody&#8217;s
shown some common sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, auntie!&#8221; Astonished, the girl held her off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
at arm&#8217;s length and stared into her face. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean to say you&#8217;ve suspected&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archer sniffed. &#8220;Suspected! Why, for weeks
and weeks I&#8217;ve been perfectly certain the creature was
up to no good. You know I never trusted him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last straw was his bringing that ridiculous
charge against Buck Green,&#8221; Mrs. Archer interrupted
with unexpected spirit. &#8220;That stamped him for what
he was; because a nicer, cleaner, better-mannered
young man I&#8217;ve seldom seen. He could no more have
stolen cattle than&mdash;than I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>A mental picture of her tiny, delicate, fragile-looking
aunt engaged in that strenuous and illicit operation
brought a momentary smile to Mary Thorne&#8217;s lips.
Then her face grew serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know I didn&#8217;t believe it&mdash;really,&#8221; she
protested. &#8220;I offered to keep him on if he&#8217;d only
assure me he wasn&#8217;t here for any&mdash;any secret reason.
But he wouldn&#8217;t, and at the time there seemed nothing
to do but let him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he might have had some other private
reason than stealing cattle,&#8221; commented Mrs. Archer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had,&#8221; returned Mary, suppressing a momentary
sense of annoyance that her aunt had shown the greater
faith. &#8220;As nearly as I can make out, he was here to
shadow Tex. As a matter of fact he really wanted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
to leave the ranch and work from a different direction,
so it turned out all right in the end. He thinks it was
Tex himself who secretly instigated the cattle-stealing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The villain!&#8221; ejaculated Mrs. Archer energetically.
&#8220;But where has&mdash;er&mdash;Buck been all this time? Where
is he now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl smiled faintly. &#8220;He was here a little
while ago. He and Bud are both with the sheriff&#8217;s
posse. They believe the men are heading for the
mountains and have gone after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archer glanced sharply at her niece, noted a
faint flush on the girl&#8217;s face, and pursed her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;When are they coming back?&#8221; she asked, after a
little pause.</p>
<p>Mary shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;Not until they
catch them, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which certainly won&#8217;t be to-night. I&#8217;m rather
surprised at Buck. It seems to me that he ought to
have stayed here to look after things, instead of rushing
off to chase outlaws.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his fault,&#8221; defended Mary quickly. &#8220;He
thought Alf and Stella were here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alf and Stella! Good gracious, child! How
could he, when they left four days ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t know that. He took it for granted
they were still here, and I let him think so. They
needed him to guide the posse, and I knew if I told him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
he&#8217;d insist on staying behind. After all, dear, there&#8217;s
nothing for us to worry about. It&#8217;ll be a bit lonesome
to-night, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worry! I&#8217;m not worrying&mdash;about myself.&#8221;
Mrs. Archer regarded her niece with a curiously keen
expression that seemed oddly incongruous in that
delicate fragile-looking face. &#8220;I&#8217;m not blind,&#8221; she
went on quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed what&#8217;s been going on&mdash;the
wretch! You&#8217;re afraid of him, too, I can see,
and no wonder. I wish somebody had stayed&mdash;Still,
we must make the best of it. What are you going to
do about the stock?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feed them,&#8221; said Mary laconically, quelling a little
shiver that went over her. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go and do it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they walked around to the corral, where
Mary forked down some hay for the three horses, and
filled the sunken water-barrel from the tank. Already
shadows were creeping up from the hollows, and the
place seemed very still and deserted.</p>
<p>In the kitchen the sense of silent emptiness was even
greater, accustomed as they were to the constant
presence of Pedro and his wife. The two women did
not linger longer than was necessary to fill a tray with
supper, which they carried into the living-room. Here
Mary closed the door, lit two lamps, and touched a
match to the wood piled up in the big fireplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll make things more cheerful,&#8221; she remarked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
with an attempt at casualness which was not altogether
successful. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why we shouldn&#8217;t heat some
water here and make tea,&#8221; she added with sudden
inspiration.</p>
<p>Mrs. Archer, who liked her cup of tea, made no
objections, and Mary sprang up and went back to the
kitchen. Filling a saucepan from the pump, she got
the tea-caddy out of a cupboard, and then paused in
the middle of the room, staring out into the gathering
dusk.</p>
<p>Neither doors nor windows in the ranch-house were
ever locked, and, save on really cold nights, they were
rarely even closed. But now, of a sudden, the girl felt
she would be much more comfortable if everything
were shut up tight, and setting down the pan and caddy
on the table, she went over to the nearest window.</p>
<p>It looked out on the various barns and sheds
clustered at the back of the ranch-house. The harness-room
occupied the ground floor of the nearest shed,
with a low, seldom-entered loft above, containing a
single, narrow window without glass or shutters.</p>
<p>As Mary approached the open kitchen window, herself
invisible in the shadows of the room, a slight sense
of movement in that little square under the eaves of
the shed roof drew her glance swiftly upward. To
her horror she caught a momentary glimpse of a face
framed in the narrow opening. It vanished swiftly&mdash;far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
too swiftly to be recognized. But recognition was
not necessary. The mere knowledge that some one was
hidden in the loft&mdash;had probably been hidden there all
along&mdash;turned the girl cold and instantly awakened her
worst fears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>LYNCH SCORES</h3>
</div>

<p>How long she stood there staring fearfully at
the empty window of the shed, Mary Thorne
had no idea. She seemed frozen and incapable of
movement. But at last, with a shiver, she came to
herself, and bending out, drew in the heavy wooden,
shutters and fumbled with the catch. The bolt was
stiff from disuse, and her hands shook so that she
was scarcely able to thrust it into the socket. Still
trembling, she closed and bolted the door and made
fast the other windows. Then she paused in the
middle of the room, slim fingers clenched tightly together,
and heart beating loudly and unevenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; she said aloud in a strained
whisper. &#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her glance sought the short passage, and, through
it, the cozy brightness of the living-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t let her know,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>After a moment more of indecision she stepped into
the small room opening off the kitchen, which had been
occupied by Pedro and his wife. Having bolted the
shutters of the single window, she came back into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
kitchen and stood beside the table, making a determined
effort for self-control. Suddenly the sound of her
aunt&#8217;s voice came from the living-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Mary? Can I help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a second the girl hesitated, nails digging painfully
into her palms. Then she managed to find her
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;No thanks, dear. I&#8217;ll be there in just a minute.&#8221;
Resolutely she took up the saucepan and caddy and
walked slowly toward the lighted doorway. She felt
that a glance at her face would probably tell Mrs.
Archer that something was wrong, and so, entering the
living-room, she went straight over to the fireplace.
Kneeling on the hearth, she took the poker and made a
little hollow amongst the burning sticks in which she
placed the covered saucepan. When she stood up the
heat had burned a convincingly rosy flush into her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was closing the shutters,&#8221; she explained in a
natural tone. &#8220;While the water&#8217;s boiling I think I&#8217;ll
do the same in the other rooms. Then we&#8217;ll feel quite
safe and snug.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archer, who was arranging their supper on
one end of the big table, agreed briefly but made no
other comment. When Mary had secured the living-room
door and windows, she took the four bedrooms
in turn, ending in the one whose incongruously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
masculine appointments had once aroused the curiosity
of Buck Green.</p>
<p>How long ago that seemed! She set her candle on
the dresser and stared around the room. If only she
wasn&#8217;t such a helpless little ninny!</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m such a fool I wouldn&#8217;t know how to use
a revolver if I had it,&#8221; thought the girl forlornly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t even know what I did with Dad&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, her glance fell upon the cartridge-belt
hanging on the wall, from whose pendant holster
protruded the butt of an efficient-looking six-shooter&mdash;Stratton&#8217;s
weapon, which, like everything else in the
room, she had left religiously as she found it.</p>
<p>Stepping forward, she took hold of it gingerly and
managed to draw it forth&mdash;a heavy, thirty-eight Colt,
the barrel rust-pitted in a few places, but otherwise in
excellent condition. She had no idea how to load it,
but presently discovered by peering into the magazine
that the shells seemed to be already in place. Then all
at once her eyes filled and a choking little sob rose in
her throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you were only here!&#8221; she whispered unevenly.</p>
<p>It would be hard to determine whether she was
thinking of Stratton, that dreamlike hero of hers,
whose tragic death she had felt so keenly, or of another
man who was very much alive indeed. Perhaps
she scarcely knew herself. At all events it was only a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
momentary little breakdown. Pulling herself together,
she returned to the living-room, carrying the big six-shooter
half hidden by her skirts, and managed to slip
it, apparently unseen, on a little stand above which hung
the telephone to Las Vegas camp. By this time the
water was boiling, and having made tea, she carried
the pot back to the big table and sat down opposite
Mrs. Archer.</p>
<p>For a minute or two she was busy with the cups and
had no occasion to observe her aunt&#8217;s expression.
Then, chancing to glance across the table, she was dismayed
to find the older woman regarding her with
searching scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; questioned Mrs. Archer briefly. &#8220;What
is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary stared at her guiltily. &#8220;What&#8217;s&mdash;what?&#8221; she
managed to parry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why beat about the bush?&#8221; retorted her aunt.
&#8220;Something&#8217;s happened to frighten you. I can see
that perfectly well. You know how I detest being
kept in the dark, so you may as well tell me at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary hesitated. &#8220;But it&mdash;it may not&mdash;come to anything,&#8221;
she stammered. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to&mdash;to
frighten you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rubbish!&#8221; An odd, delicately grim expression
came into the little old lady&#8217;s face. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather be
frightened unnecessarily than have something drop on
me out of a clear sky. Out with it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>Then Mary gave in and was conscious of a distinct
relief in having a confident.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only this,&#8221; she said briefly. &#8220;When I went to
close the back kitchen window a little while ago, I saw
a&mdash;a face looking out of that little window above the
harness-room. Some one&#8217;s&mdash;hiding there.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant Mrs. Archer&#8217;s delicately pretty, faded
face turned quite pale. Then she rallied bravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who was it?&#8221; she asked in a voice not altogether
steady.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t know. It disappeared at once. But I&#8217;m
sure it wasn&#8217;t imagination.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment or two her aunt sat thinking. Then
she glanced quickly across the room. &#8220;Is that gun
loaded?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>The girl nodded; she had ceased to be surprised at
anything. For a space Mrs. Archer regarded her untouched
cup of tea thoughtfully. When she looked up
a bright spot of pink was glowing in each wrinkled
cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not pleasant, but we must face it,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;It may be Pedro, or even Maria. Both of them
are cowards. On the other hand it may be
Lynch. There&#8217;s no use shutting one&#8217;s eyes to possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abruptly she rose and walked quickly into her bedroom,
returning in a moment or two with a little
chamois case from which she drew a tiny twenty-two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
caliber revolver, beautifully etched and silver-mounted,
with a mother-of-pearl stock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your uncle gave it to me many years ago and
showed me how to use it,&#8221; she explained, laying it beside
her plate. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never shot it off, but I see no
reason why&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke off with a gasp, and both women started
and turned pale, as a harsh, metallic rattle rang
through the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; whispered Mary, half rising.</p>
<p>&#8220;The telephone! I can&#8217;t get used to that strange
rattle. Answer it, quickly!&#8221;</p>
<p>Springing up, Mary flew across the room and took
down the receiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; she said tremulously. &#8220;Who is&mdash;<i>Oh,
Buck!</i>&#8221; Her eyes widened and the blood rushed
into her face. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad! But where are you?...
I see. No, they&#8217;re not here.... I know I
did, but I thought&mdash;I wish now I&#8217;d told you. We&mdash;we&#8217;re
frightened.... What?.... No, not yet;
but&mdash;but there&#8217;s some one hiding in the loft over the
harness-room.... I don&#8217;t know, but I saw a face at
the window.... Yes, everything&#8217;s locked up, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Abruptly she broke off and turned her head a little,
the blood draining slowly from her face. A sound had
come to her which struck terror to her heart. Yet it
was a sound familiar enough on the range-land&mdash;merely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
the beat of a horse&#8217;s hoofs, faint and far away,
but growing rapidly nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she called into the receiver, &#8220;Just a&mdash;minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her frightened eyes sought Mrs. Archer and read
confirmation in the elder woman&#8217;s strained attitude of
listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one&#8217;s coming,&#8221; the girl breathed. Suddenly
she flung herself desperately at the telephone. &#8220;Buck!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;There&#8217;s some one riding up.... I
don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m&mdash;afraid.... Yes, do come
quickly.... What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a little cry she rattled the hook and repeatedly
pressed the round button which operated the bell.
&#8220;Buck! Buck!&#8221; she cried into the receiver.</p>
<p>The thud of hoofs came clearly to her now; it was
as if the horse was galloping up the slope from the
lower gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Archer, in
a hoarse, dry voice.</p>
<p>With a despairing gesture the girl dropped the receiver
and turned a face drained of every particle
of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wire&#8217;s&mdash;dead,&#8221; she said hopelessly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Archer caught her breath sharply, but made
no other sound. In the silence that followed they
could hear the horse pull up just beyond the veranda,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
and the sound of a man dropping lightly to the ground.
Then came very faintly the murmur of voices.</p>
<p>To the two women, standing motionless, with eyes
riveted on the door, the pause that followed lengthened
interminably. It seemed as if that low, stealthy,
sibilant whispering was going on forever. Mrs.
Archer held her little pearl-handled toy with a spasmodic
grip which brought out a row of dots across
her delicate knuckles, rivaling her face in whiteness.
Mary Thorne&#8217;s gray eyes, dilated with emotion, stood
out against her pallor like deep wells of black. One
clenched hand hung straight at her side; the other
rested on the butt of the Colt, lying on the stand below
the useless instrument.</p>
<p>Suddenly the tension snapped as the heavy tread
of feet sounded across the porch and a hand rattled
the latch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open up!&#8221; called a harsh, familiar voice.</p>
<p>There was no answer. Mrs. Archer reached out
to steady herself against the table. Mary&#8217;s grip on
the Colt tightened convulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open up, I tell yuh,&#8221; repeated the voice. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
aimin&#8217; to&mdash;hurt yuh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then apparently a heavy shoulder thrust against
the door, which shook and creaked ominously. Suddenly
the girl&#8217;s slim figure straightened and she
brought her weapon around in front of her, holding
it with both hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If&mdash;if you try to force that door, I&mdash;I&#8217;ll shoot,&#8221;
she called out.</p>
<p>The only answer was an incredulous laugh, and an
instant later the man&#8217;s shoulder struck the panels with
a crash that cracked one of them and partly tore the
bolt from its insecure fastenings.</p>
<p>Promptly the girl cocked her weapon, shut both
eyes, and pulled the trigger. The recoil jerked the
barrel up, and the bullet lodged in the ceiling. Before
she could recover from the shock, there came another
crash, the shattered door swung inward, and
Tex Lynch sprang across the threshold.</p>
<p>Again Mary lifted the heavy weapon and tried to
nerve herself to fire. But somehow this was different
from shooting through a solid wooden door, and she
could not bring herself to do it. Mrs. Archer had no
such scruples. Her small, delicately-chiseled face was
no longer soft and gentle. It had frozen into a white
mask of horror, out of which the once-soft eyes blazed
with fierce determination. Bending across the table,
she leveled her toylike weapon at the advancing outlaw,
and by the merest chance sent a bullet flying so close
to his head that he ducked instinctively. An instant
later Pedro darted through the passage from the
kitchen, snatched the weapon from her hand, and
flung her roughly into a chair.</p>
<p>Her aunt&#8217;s half-stifled cry stung Mary like a lash
and roused her from the almost hypnotic state in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
which, wide-eyed and terrified, she had been watching
Lynch&#8217;s swift advance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried furiously. &#8220;You&mdash;you beast!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was within a few feet of her now, and moved
by the double impulse of fear and anger, her finger
pressed the trigger. But there was no response, and
too late the girl realized that she had failed to cock
the weapon. In another moment Lynch had
wrenched it from her hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>GONE</h3>
</div>

<p>Motionless in his saddle, save for an
occasional restless stamp of his horse, Bud
Jessup waited patiently in front of the adobe shack
at Las Vegas camp. His face was serious and
thoughtful, and his glance was fixed on the open door
through which came the broken, indistinguishable
murmur of Buck Stratton&#8217;s voice. Once, thinking he
heard an unusual sound, the youngster turned his head
alertly and stared westward through the shadows.
But a moment later his eyes flashed back to that narrow,
black oblong, and he resumed his uneasy pondering
as to what Buck might possibly be finding out.</p>
<p>Suddenly he gave a start as Stratton&#8217;s voice, harsh,
startled, came to him distinctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary! Mary! Why don&#8217;t you answer? What&#8217;s
happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were punctuated by a continuous rattle,
and ended abruptly with the clatter of metal against
metal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; rasped Buck, in a hoarse, furious voice with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
an undercurrent of keen apprehension that made Bud&#8217;s
nerves tingle. &#8220;The wire&#8217;s been cut!&#8221;</p>
<p>An instant later he appeared, running. Snatching
the reins, he gained the saddle in a single bound,
jerked his horse around, and was off across the pasture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he shouted back over one shoulder.
&#8220;There&#8217;s trouble at the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud dug spurs into his cayuse and followed, but it
was some minutes before he managed to catch up with
his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he cried anxiously. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?
Have the Mannings&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone, as I thought,&#8221; snapped Stratton.
&#8220;The two women are alone. But that isn&#8217;t the worst.&#8221;
A sudden spasm of uncontrolled fury rose in his
throat and choked him momentarily. &#8220;There&#8217;s some
one hidden in the loft over the harness-room,&#8221; he managed
to finish hoarsely.</p>
<p>Bud stared at him in dismay. &#8220;Who the devil&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. She just got a glimpse of a&mdash;a face
in the window while she was closing up the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose it&#8217;s&mdash;Tex?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; retorted Buck through his clenched
teeth. &#8220;What difference does it make, anyhow?
Some one hid there for a&mdash;a purpose. By God!
What fools we were not to make a search!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed so darn sure they&#8217;d all beat it,&#8221; faltered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
Bud. &#8220;Besides, I don&#8217;t guess any of us would of
thought to look in that loft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not. It doesn&#8217;t matter. We didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
Stratton&#8217;s voice was brittle. &#8220;But if anything happens&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they locked up the whole house?&#8221; Jessup
asked as Stratton paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but what good&#8217;ll that do with two able-bodied
men set on getting in? There isn&#8217;t a door
or shutter that wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two!&#8221; gasped Bud. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t say&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I? It was just at the end. She was telling
me about seeing the face and locking up the
house. Then all at once she broke off.&#8221; Buck&#8217;s tone
was calmer now, but it was the hard-won calm of
determined will, and every now and then there quivered
through it a faint, momentary note that told eloquently
of the mingled dread and fury that were tearing
his nerves to pieces. &#8220;I asked what was the
matter and she said to wait a minute. It seemed like
she stopped to listen for something. Then all of a
sudden she cried out that some one was riding up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it might not have been any of the gang,&#8221; murmured
Bud, voicing a hope he did not feel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else would be likely to come at this time of
night?&#8221; demanded Stratton. &#8220;Lynch is on the outs
with everybody around Perilla. They don&#8217;t go near
the ranch unless they have to. It couldn&#8217;t have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
one of Hardenberg&#8217;s men; he&#8217;s not expecting any
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did&mdash;did she say anything else?&#8221; asked Jessup,
after a brief pause.</p>
<p>Buck hesitated. &#8220;Only that she&mdash;was afraid, and
wanted us to&mdash;come quickly. Then the wire went
dead as if it had been cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence fell, broken only by the thud of hoofs and
the heavy breathing of the two horses. Bud&#8217;s slim,
lithe figure had slumped a little in the saddle, and his
eyes were fixed unseeingly on the wide, flat sweep of
prairie unfolding before them, dim and mysterious
under the brilliant stars.</p>
<p>In his mind anxiety, rage, and apprehension contended
with a dull, dead hopelessness which lay upon
his heart like lead. For something in Buck&#8217;s tone
made him realize in a flash a situation which,
strangely, he had never even suspected. He wondered
dully why he hadn&#8217;t ever thought of it before; perhaps
because Buck was a new-comer who had seemed
to see so little of Mary Thorne. Probably, also, the
very friendly manner of Stella Manning had something
to do with Jessup&#8217;s blindness. But his eyes
were opened now, thoroughly and effectually, and
for a space, how long or short he never knew, he
fought out his silent battle.</p>
<p>It ended in a victory. Down in his heart he knew
that he had never really had any hope of winning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
Mary Thorne himself. He had cherished aspirations,
of course, and dreamed wonderful dreams; but when
it came down to hard actualities, romance did not
blind him to the fact that she looked on him merely
as a friend and nothing more. Indeed, though they
were virtually of the same age, he had been aware
at times of an oddly maternal note in her attitude
toward him which was discouraging. Still, it was not
easy definitely to relinquish all hope and bring himself
to write &#8220;finis&#8221; to the end of the chapter. Indeed,
he did not reach that state of mind until, glancing
sidewise at his friend, there came to him a sudden,
faintly bitter realization of the wide contrast between
them, and of how much more Buck had to offer than
himself.</p>
<p>Stratton&#8217;s erect, broad shoulders, the lean length of
him, the way he held his head, gave Jessup a curious,
unexpected impression of strength and ability and
power. Buck&#8217;s eyes were set straight ahead and his
clean-cut profile, clearly visible in the luminous starlight,
had a look of sensitiveness and refinement, despite
the strength of his jaw and chin and the somberness
of his eyes. Bud turned away with a little sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had no chance at all,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Someway
he don&#8217;t look like a cow-puncher, nor talk quite
like one. I wonder why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Half a mile further on Buck suddenly broke the
prolonged silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking it over,&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;The
man on the horse was probably Lynch. He could
easily have started off with the rest and then made a
circuit around below the ranch-house. If he picked
his ground, we&#8217;d never notice where he left the others,
especially as we weren&#8217;t looking for anything of the
sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you s&#8217;pose hid over the harness-room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been Slim, or Kreeger, or even
Pedro. The whole thing was certainly a put-up job&mdash;damn
them!&#8221; His voice shook with sudden
passion. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll soon know,&#8221; he finished, and
his mouth clamped shut.</p>
<p>Already the row of cottonwoods that lined the creek
was faintly visible ahead, a low, vague mass, darker
a little than the background of blue-black sky. Both
spurred their jaded horses and a moment or two later
pulled up with a jerk at the gate. Before his mount
had come to a standstill, Bud was out of his saddle
fumbling with the catch. When he swung it open,
Stratton dashed through, swiftly crossed the shallow
creek, and galloped up the long, easy slope beyond.</p>
<p>A chill struck him as the ranch-house loomed up,
ominously black and desolate as any long-deserted
dwelling. He had forgotten for an instant the heavy,
wooden shutters, and when, with teeth clenched and
heart thudding in his throat, he reached the veranda
corner, the sight of that yellow glow streaming from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
the open door gave him a momentary shock of supreme
relief.</p>
<p>An instant later he saw the shattered door, and the
color left his face. In two strides he crossed the
porch and, with fingers tightening about the butt of
his Colt, he stared searchingly around the big,
brightly-lighted, strangely empty-looking room.</p>
<p>It held but a single occupant. Huddled in a chair
on the further side of the long table was Mrs. Archer.
Both hands rested on the polished oak, and clutched
in her small, wrinkled hands was a heavy, cumbrous
revolver, pointed directly at the door. Her white,
strained face, stamped with an expression of hopeless
tragedy, looked ten years older than when Buck
had last seen it. As she recognized him she dropped
the gun and tottered to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, in a sharp, wailing voice. &#8220;You!
You!&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment Buck had her in his arms, holding her
tight as one holds a hurt or frightened child. Mechanically
he soothed her as she clung to him, that amazing
self-control, which had upheld her for so long,
snapping like a taut rope when the strain becomes too
great. But all the while his eyes&mdash;wide, smoldering
eyes, filled with a mingling of pity, of dread questioning
and furious passion&mdash;swept the room searchingly.</p>
<p>Over the little lady&#8217;s bowed gray head his glance
took in swiftly a score of details&mdash;the dead fire, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
dangling receiver of the useless telephone, a little pearl-handled
revolver lying in a far corner as if it had been
flung there, an upset chair. Suddenly his gaze halted
at the edge of the shattered door and a faint tremor
shook his big body. A comb lay on the floor there&mdash;a
single comb of tortoise-shell made for a woman&#8217;s
hair. But it was a comb he knew well. And as his
eyes met Bud&#8217;s, staring from the doorway at the
strange scene, they were the eyes of a man tortured.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>BUCK RIDES</h3>
</div>

<p>Presently Mrs. Archer released her spasmodic
grip on Stratton&#8217;s flannel shirt and fumbled for
her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a fool to&mdash;to waste time like this,&#8221; she faltered,
dabbing her eyes with the crumpled square of
cambric.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re rather wonderful,&#8221; returned Buck
gently. He helped her to a chair. &#8220;Sit down here,
and when you&#8217;re able, tell us just what&mdash;happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hands dropped suddenly to her lap and she
looked up at him with wide, blazing eyes. Bud had
approached and stood on the other side of the chair,
listening intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was that creature Lynch,&#8221; she said in a voice
that trembled a little with anger and indignation. &#8220;He
was the one who rode up on horseback. It was Pedro
who was hidden in the loft. Mary told you about
that before the telephone went dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wire was cut,&#8221; muttered Stratton. &#8220;That
must have been the greaser&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave a quick nod. &#8220;Very likely. He&#8217;s equal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
to anything. They met just outside the door and
talked together. It seemed as if they&#8217;d never leave
off whispering. Mary was over by the telephone and
I stood here. She had that revolver, which she&#8217;d
found in the other room.&#8221; Her eyes indicated the
weapon on the table, and Buck was conscious of a
queer thrill as he recognized it as his own. &#8220;We
waited. At last the&mdash;the beast pounded at the door
and called to us to open. We didn&#8217;t stir. Then he
threw himself against the door, which cracked.
Mary cried out that if he tried to force it, she&#8217;d shoot.
The creature only laughed, and when she did fire,
the bullet went wild.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused an instant, her fingers twitching at the
handkerchief clasped in her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then he broke in?&#8221; questioned Buck, in a hard
voice.</p>
<p>She nodded. &#8220;Yes. I fired once, but it did no
good. Before I could shoot again, Pedro came up
from behind and snatched the revolver away. He
must have forced his way into the kitchen. He threw
me into a chair, while Lynch went after Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s lips were pressed tightly together; his
face was hard as stone. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t she fire again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know why. I couldn&#8217;t see very well.
Something may have gone wrong with the revolver;
perhaps she had scruples. I should have had none.&#8221;
Mrs. Archer&#8217;s small, delicate face looked almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
savage. &#8220;I&#8217;d have gloried in shooting the brute. At
any rate, she didn&#8217;t, and he took the weapon away
from her and flung it on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she hesitated briefly, overcome by her emotions.
Stratton&#8217;s face was stony, save for a momentary
ripple of the muscles about his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I tried to go to her, but Pedro held me in the
chair.&#8221; Mrs. Archer drew a long, quivering breath.
&#8220;Lynch had her by the wrist; I heard him say something
about not hurting her; and then he said, quite
plainly, that since she&#8217;d got him in this mess, she&#8217;d
have to get him out. I couldn&#8217;t understand, but all
at once I realized that if they did&mdash;take her away,
they&#8217;d probably tie me up, or something, to prevent
my giving the alarm, and so I pretended to faint.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted her handkerchief to her lips and let it fall
again. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t easy to lie still in that chair and
see the dear child&mdash;being dragged away. But I
knew I&#8217;d be quite helpless against those two villains.
She&mdash;she didn&#8217;t struggle much; perhaps she hadn&#8217;t
the strength.&#8221; The old lady&#8217;s voice shook, and she
began again plucking nervously at her handkerchief.
&#8220;The minute they were out of the door, I got up and
followed them. I thought perhaps I might be able
to see which way they went. It was pitch-dark, and
I crept along beside the house to the corner. I could
just see their outlines over by the corral. Pedro was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
saddling two horses. When he had done, that creature,
Lynch, made Mary mount and got on his own
horse, which he had been leading. Then the two men
began to talk. I couldn&#8217;t hear everything, but it
sounded as if they were arranging to meet somewhere.
They gave the name of a place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes searched Buck&#8217;s face with a troubled,
anxious scrutiny. &#8220;So many Arizona towns have a
foreign sound, but somehow I&mdash;I&#8217;ve never even heard
of Santa Clara.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Santa Clara!&#8221; burst out Bud. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s
over in Sonora. If he should get her across the border&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archer sprang to her feet and caught Stratton
by one arm. &#8220;Mexico!&#8221; she cried hysterically. &#8220;Oh,
Buck! You must save her from that creature! You
mustn&#8217;t let him&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sha&#8217;n&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; interrupted Stratton
harshly. &#8220;Tell me as quickly as you can what
else you heard. Was there anything said about the
way he meant to take?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archer clenched her small hands and fought
bravely for self-control. &#8220;He said he&mdash;he might be
delayed. He didn&#8217;t dare take the road through Perilla,
and the trail through the mountains was probably
blocked by the sheriff.&#8221; Her forehead wrinkled
thoughtfully. &#8220;He said the only way was to&mdash;to go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
through the pass and turn south along the edge of the
T-T land. That&mdash;that was all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s face lighted with somber satisfaction. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a good bit,&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;When they started off
did you notice which way they went?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pedro rode past the house toward the lower gate.
Lynch went straight down the slope toward the bunk-house.
He was leading Mary&#8217;s horse. I ran a little
way after them and saw them cross the creek this side
of the middle pasture gate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck shot a glance at Jessup. &#8220;The north pasture!&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;He knows there&#8217;ll be no one
around there, and it&#8217;ll be the safest way to reach the
T-T trail. I&#8217;ll saddle a fresh cayuse and be off.&#8221;
He turned to Mrs. Archer. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry,&#8221; he
said, with a momentary touch on her shoulder that
was at once a caress and an assurance. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring
her back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;They said something&mdash;It
isn&#8217;t possible that he can&mdash;force her to&mdash;to marry
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of things are possible, but he won&#8217;t have
the chance,&#8221; replied Stratton grimly. &#8220;Bud, you stay
here with Mrs. Archer, and I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; protested the old lady. &#8220;You must both
go. I don&#8217;t need any one. I&#8217;m not afraid of being
here alone. No one will come&mdash;now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t I go after Hardenberg and get him
to take a bunch around the south end of the hills,&#8221;
suggested Jessup quickly. &#8220;They might be able to
head him off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; nodded Stratton curtly. &#8220;Go to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inaction had suddenly grown intolerable. He would
have agreed to anything save the suggestion that he
delay his start even for another sixty seconds. With
a hurried good-by to Mrs. Archer, he hastened from
the room, swung into his saddle, and rode swiftly
around to the corral. A brief search through the
darkness showed him that only a single horse remained
there. He lost not a moment in roping the animal,
and was transferring his saddle from Pete, when Bud
appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to catch a horse from the <i>remuda</i>,&#8221;
he said briefly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken the last one. Turn
Pete into the corral, will you, and give him a little
feed.&#8221; Straightening up, he turned the stirrup,
mounted swiftly, and spurred his horse forward.
&#8220;So-long,&#8221; he called back over one shoulder.</p>
<p>The thud of hoofs drowned Bud&#8217;s reply, and as the
night closed about him, Buck gave a faint sigh of
relief. There was a brief delay at the gate, and then,
heading northwest, he urged the horse to a canter.</p>
<p>He was taking a chance in following this short cut
through the middle pasture, but he felt he had no
choice. To attempt to trail Lynch would be futile,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
and if he waited until dawn, the scoundrel would be
hopelessly in the lead. He knew of only one pass
through the mountains to T-T ground, and for this
he headed, convinced that it was also Lynch&#8217;s goal,
and praying fervently that the scoundrel might not
change his mind.</p>
<p>He was under no delusions as to the task which
lay before him. Lynch would be somewhat handicapped
by the presence of the girl, especially if he
continued to lead her horse. But he had a good hour&#8217;s
start, and once in the mountains the handicap would
vanish. The chase was likely to be prolonged, particularly
as Lynch knew every foot of the mountain
trail and the country beyond, which Stratton had never
seen.</p>
<p>But the presence of difficulties only strengthened
Buck&#8217;s resolution and confidence. As he sped on
through the luminous darkness, the cool night wind
brushing his face, a seething rage against Tex Lynch
dominated him. Now and then the thought of Mary
Thorne came to torture him. Vividly he pictured the
scene at the ranch-house which Mrs. Archer had described,
imagining the girl&#8217;s fear and horror and
despair, then and afterward, with a realism which
made him wince. But always his mind flashed back
to the man who was to blame for it all, and with
savage curses he pledged himself to a reckoning.</p>
<p>And so, with mind divided between alternating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
spasms of tenderness and fury, he came at last to
the further side of middle pasture and dismounted
to let down the fence. It was characteristic of the
born and bred ranchman that instead of riding swiftly
on and letting the cut wires dangle, he automatically
obeyed one of the hard and fast rules of the range
and fastened them behind him. He did not pause
again until he reached the little sheltered nook in the
face of the high cliffs, out of which led the trail.</p>
<p>Had those two passed yet, or were they still out
there somewhere in the sandy wastes of north pasture?
He wondered as he reined in his horse. He
scarcely dared hope that already he could have forestalled
the crafty Lynch, but it was important to make
sure. And so, slipping out of the saddle, he flung
the reins over the roan&#8217;s head and, walking forward
a few steps, lit a match and searched the ground carefully
for any signs.</p>
<p>Three matches had been consumed before he found
what he was looking for&mdash;the fresh prints of two
horses leading toward the trail. Hastily returning to
his cayuse, he swung into the saddle and headed the
roan toward the grade. They were ahead of him, then;
but how far?</p>
<p>It was impossible to make any speed along the rough
uncertainties of this rocky trail, but Buck wasted no
time. Down in the further hollow he turned aside to
the spring, not knowing when he would again find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
water for his horse. He did not dismount, and as
the roan plunged velvet nozzle into the spring, a picture
rose in Buck&#8217;s mind of that other day&mdash;how long
ago it seemed!&mdash;when he himself, sagging painfully
in the saddle, had sucked the water with as great an
eagerness out of a woman&#8217;s soggy Stetson, and then,
over the limp brim, gazed gratefully into a pair of
tender hazel eyes which tried in vain to mask anxiety
beneath a surface of lightness.</p>
<p>He bit his lips and struck the saddle-horn fiercely
with one clenched fist. When the horse had finished
drinking, he turned him swiftly and, regaining the
trail, pushed on feverishly at reckless speed.</p>
<p>About an hour later the first pale signs of dawn
began to lighten the darkness. Slowly, gradually,
almost imperceptibly, a cold gray crept into the sky,
blotting out the stars. Little by little the light
strengthened, searching out shadowy nooks and
corners, revealing this peak or that, widening the
horizon, until at length the whole, wide, tumbled mass
of peak and precipice, of cañon, valley, and tortuous,
twisted mountain trail lay revealed in all its grim,
lifeless, forbidding desolation.</p>
<p>From his point of vantage at the summit of a steep
grade, Buck halted and stared ahead with a restless,
keen eagerness. He could see the trail curving over
the next rise, and farther still he glimpsed a tiny patch
of it rounding the shoulder of a hill. But it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
empty, lifeless; and as he loosed the reins and touched
the roan lightly with a spur, Stratton&#8217;s face grew
blank and hard again.</p>
<p>From somewhere amongst the rocks the long-drawn,
quavering howl of a coyote sounded mournfully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>CARRIED AWAY</h3>
</div>

<p>The same dawn unrolled before the eyes of a
man and a girl, riding southward along the
ragged margin of the T-T ranch. Westward
stretched the wide, rolling range-land, empty at the
moment of any signs of life. And somehow, for the
very reason that one expected something living there,
it seemed even more desolate than the rough, broken
country bordering the mountains on the other side.</p>
<p>That, at least, was Mary Thorne&#8217;s thought. Emerging
from the mountain trail just as dawn broke, her
eyes brightened as she took in the flat, familiar country,
even noting a distant line of wire fence, and for
the first time in many hours despair gave place to
sudden hope. Where there was range-land there
must be cattle and men to tend them, and her experience
with Western cow-men had not been confined to
those of Lynch&#8217;s type. Him she knew now, to her
regret and sorrow, to be the great exception. The
majority were clean-cut, brave, courteous, slow of
speech, perhaps, but swift in action; simple of mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
and heart&mdash;the sort of man, in short, to whom a
woman in distress might confidently turn for help.</p>
<p>But presently, as the rising sun, gilding the peaks
that towered above her, emphasized the utter emptiness
of those sweeping pastures, the light died out of her
eyes and she remembered with a sinking heart the
blackleg scourge which had so recently afflicted the
T-T outfit. There had been much discussion of it
at the Shoe-Bar, and now she recalled vaguely hearing
that it had first broken out in these very pastures.
Doubtless, as a method of prevention, the surviving
stock had been moved elsewhere, and her chances for
help would be as likely in the midst of a trackless
desert as here.</p>
<p>The reaction made her lips quiver and there swept
over her with renewed force that wave of despair
which had been gaining strength all through those
interminable black hours. She had done her best to
combat it. Over and over again she told herself that
the situation was far from hopeless. Something must
happen. Some one&mdash;mostly she thought of Buck,
though she did not name him even to herself&mdash;would
come to her aid. It was incredible that in this day and
generation a person could be successfully carried off
even by one as crafty, resourceful, and unscrupulous
as Tex Lynch. But in spite of all her reasoning there
remained in the back of Mary&#8217;s mind a feeling of cold
horror, born of those few sentences she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
overheard while Pedro was saddling the horses. Like a
poisonous serpent, it reared its ugly head persistently,
to demolish in an instant her most specious arguments.
The very thought of it now filled her with the same
fear and dread that had overwhelmed her when the
incredible words first burned into her consciousness,
and made her glance with a sudden, sharp terror at the
man beside her. She met a stare from his bold,
heavy-lidded eyes that sent the blood flaming into her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; queried Lynch, smiling. &#8220;Feelin&#8217; better,
now it&#8217;s mornin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl made no answer. Hastily averting her
eyes, she rode on in silence, lips pressed together and
chin a little tilted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sulking, eh?&#8221; drawled Lynch. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
good? Yuh can&#8217;t keep that sort of thing up forever.
After we&#8217;re&mdash;married&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused significantly. The girl&#8217;s lip quivered
but she set her teeth into it determinedly. Presently,
with an effort, she forced herself to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you rather wasting time trying to&mdash;to
frighten me with that sort of rubbish?&#8221; she asked
coldly. &#8220;In these days marriage isn&#8217;t something that
can be forced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s laugh was not agreeable. &#8220;Oh, is that
so?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;You&#8217;re likely to learn a thing or
two before long, I&#8217;ll say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>His tone was so carelessly confident, so entirely
assured, that in an instant her pitiful little pretense
of courage was swept away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so!&#8221; she cried, turning on him with wide
eyes and quivering lips. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t&mdash; There
isn&#8217;t a&mdash;real clergyman who&#8217;d do&mdash;do such a thing.
No one could force me to&mdash;to&mdash; Why, I&#8217;d rather
die than&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, choking. Lynch shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, yuh wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;Dyin&#8217; is
mighty easy to talk about, but when yuh get right
down to it, I reckon you&#8217;d change yore mind. I
don&#8217;t see why yore so dead set against me,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t so hard to look at, am I? An&#8217; with me as
yore husband, things will&mdash;will be mighty different on
the ranch. You&#8217;ll never have to pinch an&#8217; worry like
yuh do now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears blinded her, and, turning away quickly, she
stared unseeing through a blurring haze, fighting desperately
for at least a semblance of self-control. He
was so confident, so terribly sure of himself! What
if he could do the thing he said? She did not see how
such a ghastly horror could be possible; but then,
what did she know of conditions in the place to which
he was taking her?</p>
<p>Suddenly, as she struggled against that overpowering
weight of misery and despair, her thoughts flew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
longingly to another man, and for an instant she
seemed to look into his eyes&mdash;whimsical, a little
tender, with a faint touch of suppressed longing in
their clear gray depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck! Oh, Buck!&#8221; she yearned under her breath.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden she felt a hand on her bridle and
became aware that Lynch was speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stop here for a bit,&#8221; he informed her briefly.
&#8220;You&#8217;d better get down and stretch yoreself.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, a little puzzled. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite
comfortable as I am,&#8221; she returned stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect yuh are,&#8221; he said meaningly. &#8220;But I
ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; any chances.&#8221; With a wave of his hand
he indicated a steepish knoll that rose up on their left.
&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; up there to look around an&#8217; see what the
country looks like ahead,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
both cayuses along, jest in case yuh should take the
notion to go for a little canter. Sabe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word she slipped out of the saddle and,
moving to one side, listlessly watched him gather up
the reins of her horse and ride toward the foot of the
hill. Its lower levels sloped easily, and in spite of the
handicap of the led horse, who pulled back and seemed
reluctant to follow, Lynch took it with scarcely a
pause.</p>
<p>There came a point, however, about half way to the
summit, from which he would have to proceed on foot.
Lynch dismounted briskly enough and tied both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
horses to a low bush. Then, instead of starting
directly on the brief upward climb, he turned and
glanced back to where Mary stood.</p>
<p>That glance, indicating doubt and suspicion, set the
girl suddenly to wondering. Ever so little her slim
figure straightened, losing its discouraged droop.
Was it possible? He seemed to think so, or why had
he looked back so searchingly? Guardedly her glance
swept to right and left. A hundred feet or so to the
south a spur of the little hill thrust out, hiding what
lay beyond. If she could reach it, might there not
possibly be some spot in all that jumble of rocks and
gullies where she at least might hide?</p>
<p>Filled with a new wild hope; realizing that nothing
she might do could make her situation worse, Mary&#8217;s
eyes returned to the climbing man, and she watched
him narrowly. Little by little, when his back was toward
her, she edged toward the spur. She told herself
that when he reached the top she would make a
dash, but in the end her tense, raw nerves played her
false. Quivering with eagerness, she held herself together
until he was within twenty feet or more of the
summit, and then her self-control snapped abruptly.</p>
<p>She had covered scarcely a dozen yards over the
rough ground when a hoarse shout of surprise came
from Lynch, followed by the clatter of rolling stones
as he plunged back down the hill. But she did not
turn her head; there was no time or need. Running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
as she had never run before, she rounded the spur and
with a gasp of dismay saw that the cliffs curved back
abruptly, forming an intervening open space that
seemed to extend for miles, but which, in reality, was
only a few hundred yards across.</p>
<p>Still she did not halt, but sped on gamely, heading
for the mouth of the nearest gully. Presently the
thud of hoofs terrified her, but stung her to even
greater effort. Nearer the hoofs-beats came, and
nearer still. Breathless, panting, she knew now she
could never reach the gully. The realization sent her
heart sinking like a lead plummet, but fear drove her
blindly on. Suddenly the bulk of a horse loomed beside
her and a man&#8217;s easy, sneering laugh bit into her
soul like vitriol. An instant later Lynch leaped from
his saddle and caught her around the waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh would, would yuh?&#8221; he cried, gazing down
into her flushed, frightened face. &#8220;Tried to shake
me, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment he held her thus, devouring her with
his eyes, holding the bridles of both horses in his free
hand. Then all at once he laughed again, hatefully,
and crushing her to him, he kissed her, roughly,
savagely&mdash;kissed her repeatedly on the lips and cheeks
and throat.</p>
<p>Mary cried out once and tried to struggle. Then
of a sudden her muscles relaxed and she lay limply in
his arms, eyes closed, wishing that she might die, or,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
better yet, that some supreme force would suddenly
strike the creature dead.</p>
<p>How long she lay there shuddering with disgust and
loathing, she did not know. It seemed an eternity before
she realized that his lips no longer touched her,
and opening her eyes she was startled at the sight of
his face.</p>
<p>It was partly turned away from her as he stared
southward across the flats. His eyes were wide,
incredulous, and filled with a mingling of anger and
dismay. In another moment he jerked her roughly to
her feet, dragged her around to the side of her horse,
and fairly flung her into the saddle. Vaulting into
his own, he spurred the beast savagely and rode back
toward the out-thrust spur at a gallop, dragging the
unwilling Freckles with him.</p>
<p>Gripping the saddle-horn to keep her precarious
seat, Mary yet found time for a hurried backward
glance before she was whisked out of sight of that
wide stretch of open country to the south. But that
glance was enough to make her heart leap. Dots&mdash;moving
dots which she had no difficulty in recognizing
as horsemen&mdash;were sweeping northward along the
edge of the breaks. Who they were she neither knew
nor cared. It was enough that they were men. Her
eyes sparkled, and a wild new hope flamed up within
her, even though she was being carried swiftly away
from them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></p>
<p>Once in the shelter of the spur, Lynch did not halt
but rode on at full speed, heading northward. For
half a mile or so the thudding hoof-beats of the two
horses alone broke the silence. Then, as their advance
opened up a fresh sweep of country, Lynch jerked his
mount to a standstill with a suddenness that raised a
cloud of dust about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; he rasped, staring from under narrowing
lids.</p>
<p>For full half a minute he sat motionless, his face
distorted with baffled fury and swiftly growing fear.
Then his eyes flashed toward the hills on the right and
swept them searchingly. A second later he had turned
his cayuse and was speeding towards a narrow break
between two spurs, keeping a tight hold on the girl&#8217;s
bridle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You try any monkey tricks,&#8221; he flung back over
one shoulder, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll&mdash;kill yuh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary made no answer, but the savage ferocity of
his tone made her shiver, and she instantly
abandoned the plan she had formed of trying, by little
touches of hand and heel, to make Freckles still
further hamper Lynch&#8217;s actions. Through the settling
dust-haze she had seen the cause of his perturbation&mdash;a
single horseman less than a mile away galloping
straight toward them&mdash;and felt that her enemy was
cornered. But the very strength of her exultation gave
her a passionate longing for life and happiness, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
she realized vividly the truth of Lynch&#8217;s callous,
sneering words, that when one actually got down to it,
it was not an easy thing to die. She must take no
chances. Surely it could be only a question of a little
time now before she would be free.</p>
<p>But presently her high confidence began to fade.
With the manner of one on perfectly familiar ground,
Lynch rode straight into the break between the rocks,
which proved to be the entrance to a gully that widened
and then turned sharply to the right. Here he stopped
and ordered Mary to ride in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go ahead,&#8221; he growled, flinging her the reins.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose any time, neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without question she obeyed, choosing the way from
his occasional, tersely flung directions. This led them
upward, slowly, steadily with many a twist and turn,
until at length, passing through a narrow opening in
the rocks, Mary came out suddenly on a ledge scarcely
a dozen feet in width. On one side the cliffs rose in
irregular, cluttered masses, too steep to climb. On
the other was a precipitous drop into a cañon of unknown
depth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get down,&#8221; ordered Lynch, swinging out of his
saddle.</p>
<p>As she slid to the ground he handed her his bridle-reins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the horses a ways back an&#8217; hold &#8217;em,&#8221; he told
her curtly. &#8220;An&#8217; remember this: Not a peep out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
yuh, or it&#8217;ll be yore last. Nobody yet&#8217;s double-crossed
me an&#8217; got away with it, an&#8217; nobody ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to&mdash;not even a woman. That cañon&#8217;s pretty deep, an&#8217;
there&#8217;s sharp stones a-plenty at the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>White-faced and tight-lipped, she turned away from
him without a word and led the two horses back to the
point he indicated. The ledge, which sloped sharply
upward, was cluttered with loose stones, and she moved
slowly, avoiding these with instinctive caution and
trying not to glance toward the precipice. A dozen
feet away she paused, holding the horses tightly by
their bridles and pressing herself against the lathered
neck of Freckles, who she knew was steady. Then
she glanced back and caught her breath with a swift,
sudden intake.</p>
<p>Kneeling close to the opening, but a little to one
side, Lynch was whirling the cylinder of his Colt.
Watching him with fascinated horror, Mary saw him
break the weapon, closely inspect the shells, close it
again, and test the trigger. Then, revolver gripped in
right hand, he settled himself into a slightly easier
position, eyes fixed on the opening and head thrust a
little forward in an attitude of listening.</p>
<p>Only too well she guessed his purpose. He was
waiting in ambush to &#8220;get&#8221; that solitary horseman
they had seen riding from the north. Whether or not
he had come here for the sole purpose of luring the
other to his death, Mary had no notion. But she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
see clearly that once this stranger was out of the way,
Lynch would at least have a chance to penetrate into
the mountains before the others from the south arrived
to halt him.</p>
<p>Slowly, interminably the minutes ticked away as
the girl stood motionless, striving desperately to think
of something she might do to prevent the catastrophe.
If only she had some way of knowing when the
stranger was near she might cry out a warning, even at
the risk of Lynch&#8217;s violence. But thrust here in
the background as she was, the unknown was likely
to come within range of Lynch&#8217;s gun before she even
knew of his approach.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of the dead silence, the clatter of a
pebble struck on the girl&#8217;s raw nerves and made her
wince. She saw the muscles of Lynch&#8217;s back stiffen
and the barrel of his Colt flash up to cover the narrow
entrance to the ledge. For an instant she hesitated,
choked by the beating of her heart. Should she cry
out? Was it the man really coming? Her dry lips
parted, and then all at once a curious, slowly moving
object barely visible above the rocky shoulder that
sheltered Lynch, startled her and kept her silent.</p>
<p>In that first flash she had no idea what it was. Then
abruptly the truth came to her. It was the top of a
man&#8217;s Stetson. The ledge sloped upward, and where
she stood it was a good two feet higher than at the
entrance. A man was riding up the outer slope and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
remembering the steepness of it, Mary knew that, in
a moment, more of him would come into view before
he became visible to Lynch.</p>
<p>White-faced, dry-lipped, she waited breathlessly.
Now she could see the entire hat. A second later she
glimpsed the top of an ear, a bit of forehead, a
sweeping look of dark-brown hair&mdash;and her heart died
suddenly within her.</p>
<p>The man was Buck Green!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>THE FIGHT ON THE LEDGE</h3>
</div>

<p>In that instant of supreme horror, Mary Thorne
found time to be thankful that terror struck her
momentarily dumb. For now, with lips parted
and a cry of warning trembling there, she saw that it
was too late. Like a pointer freezing to the scent,
Lynch&#8217;s whole body had stiffened; one hand gripped
the leveled Colt, a finger caressed the trigger. At this
juncture a cry would almost surely bring that tiny,
muscular contraction which might be fatal.</p>
<p>From behind the ledge Buck&#8217;s hat had disappeared,
and a faint creak of saddle-leather told the girl that he
had dismounted and by so doing must have moved a
trifle out of range.</p>
<p>Sick with horror and desperation, the girl&#8217;s eye fell
upon a stone lying at her feet&mdash;a jagged piece of
granite perhaps twice the size of a baseball. In a flash
she dropped the bridle-reins and, bending, caught it up
stealthily. Freckles pricked his ears forward, but with
a fleeting, imploring touch of one hand against his
sweaty neck, Mary steadied herself for a moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
slowly drew back her arm, and, with a fervent, silent
prayer for strength, she hurled the stone.</p>
<p>It grazed Lynch&#8217;s face and struck his wrist with a
force that jerked up the barrel of the revolver. The
spurt of flame, the sharp crack of the shot, the clatter
of the Colt striking the edge of the precipice, all seemed
to the girl to come simultaneously. A belated second
afterward Lynch&#8217;s furious curses came to her. With
dilated eyes she saw him snatch frantically at the
sliding weapon, and as it toppled out of sight into the
cañon barely an inch ahead of his clutching, striving
fingers, she thrilled with sudden fierce joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse you!&#8221; he frothed, springing up and rushing
at her. &#8220;You&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck!&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;Quick! His gun&#8217;s gone!
He&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A blow from his fist struck her mouth and flung her
backward against the horse. Half fainting, she saw
Freckles lunge over her shoulder and heard the vicious
click of his teeth snapping together. But Lynch,
ducking out of reach of the angry horse, caught Mary
about the waist and dragged her toward the precipice.</p>
<p>Involuntarily she closed her eyes. When she opened
them again, stirred by the curious silence and the
sudden cessation of all movement, she found herself
staring dazedly into the face of Buck Green.</p>
<p>He stood very quietly just inside the narrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
entrance to the ledge, not more than ten feet from her.
In one hand was a six-shooter; the other hung straight
at his side, the fingers tightly clenched. As he met her
bewildered glance, his eyes softened tenderly and the
corners of his lips curved in a momentary, reassuring
smile. Then abruptly his face froze again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh take another step an&#8217; down she&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said
a hoarse voice close to the girl&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>It was Lynch; and Mary, her senses clearing, knew
whose hands gripped her so tightly that she could
scarcely breathe. Glancing sidewise, she hastily
averted her eyes. She was standing within six inches
of the edge of the precipice. For the first time she
could look down into those sheer depths, and even that
hurried glimpse made her shiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I admit you&#8217;ve got the bulge on me, as it
were.&#8221; Buck&#8217;s voice suddenly broke the silence.
&#8220;Still, I don&#8217;t see how you&#8217;re going to get out of this
hole. You can&#8217;t stand like this forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary stared at him, amazed at his cool, drawling,
matter-of-fact tone. She was still more puzzled to
note that he seemed to be juggling with his revolver
in a manner which seemed, to say the least, extraordinarily
careless.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can stand here till I get tired,&#8221; retorted Lynch.
&#8220;After that&mdash; Well, I&#8217;d as soon end up down there
as get a bullet through my ribs. One thing, I
wouldn&#8217;t go alone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I offered to let you go free if you give up
Miss Thorne?&#8221; Stratton asked with sudden earnestness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Offer? Hell! Yuh can&#8217;t fool me with that kind
of talk. Not unless yuh hand over yore gun, that is.
Do that, an&#8217; I might consider the proposition&mdash;not
otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck hesitated, his eyes flashing from the weapon
he whirled so carelessly between his fingers to Lynch,
whose eyes regarded him intently over the girl&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be putting an awful lot of trust in
you,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;Once you had the gun,
what&#8217;s to prevent you from drilling me&mdash;Oh,
damn!&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a sudden, ineffectual grab at the gun,
which had slipped from his fingers, and missed. As
the weapon clattered against the rocks, Lynch&#8217;s
covetous glance followed it involuntarily. What
happened next was a bewildering whirl of violent,
unexpected action.</p>
<p>To Mary it seemed as if Buck cleared the space between
them in a single amazing leap. He landed with
one foot slipping on the ragged edge of the precipice,
and apparently threw his whole weight sidewise against
Lynch and the girl he held. Just how it happened she
did not know, but in another moment Mary found herself
freed from those hateful, gripping hands and flung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
back against her horse, while at her feet the two men
grappled savagely.</p>
<p>Over and over on the narrow confines of the sloping
ledge they struggled fiercely, heaving, panting, with
muscles cracking, each seemingly possessed with a grim
determination to thrust the other into the abyss.
Now Buck was uppermost; again Lynch, by some
clever trick, tore himself from Stratton&#8217;s hold to gain
a momentary advantage.</p>
<p>Like one meshed in the thralls of some hateful nightmare,
the girl crouched against her horse, her face so
still and white and ghastly that it might well have
been some clever sculptor&#8217;s bizarre conception of
&#8220;Horror&#8221; done in marble. Only her eyes seemed to
live. Wide, dilated, glittering with an unnatural light,
they shifted constantly, following the progress of those
two writhing bodies.</p>
<p>Once, when Lynch&#8217;s horse snorted and moved
uneasily, she caught his bridle and quieted him with a
soothing word, her voice so choked and hoarse that
she scarcely knew it. Again, as the men rolled toward
the outer side of the ledge and seemed for a moment
almost to overhang the precipice, she gave a smothered
cry and darted forward, moved by some wild impulse
to fling her puny strength into the scale against the
outlaw.</p>
<p>But with a heave of his big body, Buck saved himself
as he had done more than once before, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
struggle was resumed. Back and forth they fought,
over and over around that narrow space, until Mary
was filled with the dazed feeling that it had been going
on for ever, that it would never end.</p>
<p>But not for an instant did she cease to follow every
tiny variation of the fray, and of a sudden she gave
another cry. Gripped in a fierce embrace, the two men
rolled toward the entrance to the ledge, and all at once
Mary saw one of Lynch&#8217;s hands close over and
instantly seize the revolver Buck had dropped there.</p>
<p>Instantly she darted forward and tried to wrest it
from his grasp. Finding his strength too great, she
straightened swiftly and lifting one foot, brought her
riding boot down fiercely with all her strength on
Lynch&#8217;s hand. With a smothered grunt his fingers
laxed, and she caught up the weapon and stepped
quickly back, wondering, if Lynch came uppermost,
whether she would dare to try to shoot him.</p>
<p>No scruples now deterred her. These had vanished
utterly, and with them fear, nervousness, fatigue, and
every thought of self. For the moment she was like
the primitive savage, willing to do anything on earth to
save&mdash;her man! But so closely were the two men entwined
that she was afraid if she shot at Lynch the
bullet might injure Buck.</p>
<p>Once more the fight veered close to the precipice.
Lynch was again uppermost; and, whether by his
greater strength, or from some injury Buck had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
sustained against the rocks, the girl was seized by a
horrible conviction that he had the upper hand. Knees
gripping Stratton about the body, hands circling his
throat, Lynch, apparently oblivious to the blows rained
on his chest and neck, was slowly but surely forcing his
opponent over the ragged margin of the ledge. It was
at this instant that the frantic girl discovered that her
weapon had suffered some damage when it fell and
was quite useless.</p>
<p>Already Buck&#8217;s head overhung the precipice, his face
a dark, strangled red. Flinging the revolver from
her, Mary rushed forward and began to beat Lynch
wildly with her small, clenched fists.</p>
<p>But she might as effectually have tried to move a
rooted tree, and with a strangled cry, she wound her
fingers in his coarse black hair and strove with all
her strength to drag Lynch back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>THE DEAD HEART</h3>
</div>

<p>Vaguely, as of a sound coming from far distances,
the crack of a revolver-shot penetrated
to the girl&#8217;s numbed brain. It did not surprise her.
Indeed, it roused only a feeling of the mildest curiosity
in one whose nerves had been strained almost to the
breaking-point. When Lynch, with a hoarse cry,
toppled back against her, she merely stepped quickly
to one side, and an instant later she was on her knees
beside Stratton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck!&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;Oh, Buck!&#8221; clutching at
him as if from some wild fear that he would topple
into the abyss.</p>
<p>Hands suddenly put her gently to one side, and
some one dragged Stratton from his dangerous
position and supported him against an upraised knee.
It was Bud Jessup, and behind him loomed the figures
of Sheriff Hardenberg and several of his men.</p>
<p>Mary&#8217;s glance noted them briefly, incuriously, returning
anxiously to the man beside her. His eyes
were open now, and he was sucking in the air in deep,
panting gulps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How yuh feelin&#8217;?&#8221; asked Bud briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;get my breath,&#8221; mumbled Buck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh hurt any place?&#8221; Jessup continued, after a
brief pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to speak of,&#8221; returned Stratton in a stronger
tone. &#8220;When I first jumped for the cuss, I hit my
head the devil of a crack, and&mdash;pretty near went out.
But that don&#8217;t matter&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes sought the girl&#8217;s and dwelt there, longingly,
caressingly. There was tribute in their depths,
appreciation, and something stronger, more abiding
which brought a faint flush into her tired face and
made her heart beat faster. Presently, when he staggered
to his feet and took a step or two toward her, she
felt no shame in meeting him half way. Quite as naturally
as his arm slipped around her shoulders, her
lifted hands rested against the front of his flannel
shirt, torn into ribbons and stained with grime.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a little one,&#8221; he murmured, looking down into
her eyes, &#8220;you&#8217;re some spunky fighter, believe me!&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed deeper and her lids drooped. Of a
sudden Sheriff Hardenberg spoke up briskly:</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a right nice shot, kid. You got him
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was standing beside the body sprawling on the
ground, and the words had scarcely left his lips when
Lynch&#8217;s eyes opened slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yuh got me,&#8221; he mumbled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></p>
<p>Slowly his glance swept the circle of faces until it
rested finally on the man and girl standing close together.
For a long moment he stared at them silently,
his pale lips twitching. Then all at once a look
of cunning satisfaction swept the baffled fury from
his smoldering eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh got me,&#8221; he repeated in a stronger voice.
&#8220;Looks like yuh got her, too. Maybe yuh think
you&#8217;ve gobbled up the ranch, likewise, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; everything.
That&#8217;s where yuh get stung.&#8221;</p>
<p>He fell to coughing suddenly, and for a few minutes
his great body was racked with violent paroxysms
that brought a bright crimson stain to the sleeve he
flung across his mouth. But all the while his eyes,
full of strange venomous triumph, never once left
Stratton&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh see,&#8221; he choked out finally, &#8220;the ranch&mdash;ain&#8217;t&mdash;hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, speechless; and Mary, looking down on
him, felt merely that his brain was wandering and
found room in her heart to be a little sorry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why ain&#8217;t it hers?&#8221; demanded Bud with youthful
impetuosity. &#8220;Her father left it to her, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his to&mdash;to leave. He stole it.&#8221; Lynch&#8217;s
voice was weaker, but his eyes still glowed with hateful
triumph. &#8220;He forged the deed&mdash;from&mdash;from
papers&mdash;Stratton left with him&mdash;when he went&mdash;to
war.&#8221; He moistened his dry lips with his tongue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
&#8220;When Stratton was&mdash;killed&mdash;he didn&#8217;t leave&mdash;no kin&mdash;to
make trouble, an&#8217; Thorne&mdash;took a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice faltered, ceased. Mary stared at him
dumbly, a slow, oppressive dread creeping into her
heart. Little forgotten things flashed back into her
mind. Her father&#8217;s financial reverses, his reticence
about the acquisition of the Shoe-Bar, the strange hold
Lynch had seemed to have on him, rose up to torment
her. Suddenly she glanced quickly at Buck for reassurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be. My
father&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly the words died on her lips. There was love,
tenderness, pity in the man&#8217;s eyes, but no&mdash;denial!</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it, though?&#8221; Lynch spoke in a labored
whisper; his eyes were glazing. &#8220;Yuh thinks&mdash;I&#8217;m&mdash;loco.
I&mdash;ain&#8217;t. It&#8217;s&mdash;gospel truth. Yuh find Quinlan,
the&mdash;the witness. No, Quinlan&#8217;s dead. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;Kaylor.
Kaylor got&mdash;got&mdash; What was I
sayin&#8217;.&#8221; He plucked feebly at his chap-belt. &#8220;I know.
Kaylor got&mdash;a clean thousand for&mdash;for swearin&#8217;&mdash;the
signature&mdash;was&mdash;Stratton&#8217;s. Yuh find Kaylor. Hardenberg ...
thumbscrew ... the truth....&#8221;</p>
<p>The low, uneven whisper merged into a murmur;
then silence fell, broken only by the labored breathing
of the dying man. Dazed, bewildered, conscious
of a horrible conviction that he spoke the truth, Mary
stood frozen, struggling against a wave of utter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
weariness and despair that surged over her. She felt the
arm about her tighten, but for some strange reason
the realization brought her little comfort.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hardenberg broke the silence. He had
been watching the girl, and could no longer bear the
misery in her white, strained face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;ve turned a smart trick, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he snapped with angry impulsiveness. &#8220;As a
matter of fact the ranch belongs to him already. The
man you&#8217;ve known as Green is Buck Stratton himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynch&#8217;s lids flashed up. &#8220;Yuh&mdash;lie!&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;Stratton&#8217;s&mdash;dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing like it,&#8221; retorted the sheriff. &#8220;The papers
got it wrong. He was only badly wounded. This
fellow here is Buck Stratton, and he can prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spasm quivered over Lynch&#8217;s face. He tried to
speak, but only a faint gurgle came from his blood-flecked
lips. Too late Hardenberg, catching an angry
glance from Buck, realized and regretted his impulsive
indiscretion. For Mary Thorne, turning slowly like
a person in a dream, stared into the face of the man
beside her, lips quivering and eyes full of a great
horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; she faltered, in a pitiful, small voice.
&#8220;You&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton held her closer, a troubled tenderness
sweeping the anger from his eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but, Mary&mdash;&#8221; he stammered&mdash;&#8220;what difference
does&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly her nerves snapped under the culminating
strain of the past few hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Difference!&#8221; she cried hysterically. &#8220;Difference!&#8221;
Her heart lay like a cold, dead thing within her; she
felt utterly miserable and alone. &#8220;You&mdash;My father!
Oh, God!&#8221;</p>
<p>She made a weak effort to escape from his embrace.
Then, abruptly, her slim, girlish figure grew limp, her
head fell back against Stratton&#8217;s shoulder, her eyes
closed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h3>TWO TRAILS CONVERGE</h3>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Archer sat alone in the ranch-house
living-room, doing absolutely nothing. As a
matter of fact, she had little use for those minor
solaces of knitting or crocheting which soothe the
waking hours of so many elderly women. More than
once, indeed, she had been heard to state with mild
emphasis that when she was no longer able to entertain
herself with human nature, or, at the worst, with
an interesting book, it would be high time to retire
into a nunnery, or its modern equivalent.</p>
<p>Sitting there beside one of the sunny southern windows,
her small, faintly wrinkled hands lying reposefully
in her lap, she made a dainty, attractive picture
of age which was yet not old. Her hair was frankly
gray, but luxuriant and crisply waving. No one
would have mistaken the soft, faded pink of her complexion,
well preserved though it was, for that of a
young woman. But her eyes, bright, eager, humorous,
changing with every mood, were full of the
fire of eternal youth.</p>
<p>Just now there was a thoughtful retrospection in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
their clear depths. Occasionally she glanced interestedly
out of the window, or turned her head questioningly
toward the closed door of her niece&#8217;s bedroom.
But for the most part she sat quietly thinking,
and the tolerant, humorous curve of her lips
showed that her thoughts were far from disagreeable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Astonishing!&#8221; she murmured presently. &#8220;Really
quite amazing! And yet things could scarcely have
turned out more&mdash;&#8221; She paused, a faint wrinkle
marring the smoothness of her forehead. &#8220;Really,
I must guard against this habit of talking to myself,&#8221;
she went on with mild vexation. &#8220;They say it&#8217;s one
of the surest signs of age. Come in!&#8221;</p>
<p>The outer door opened and Buck Stratton entered.
Pausing for an instant on the threshold, he glanced
eagerly about the room, his face falling a little as he
walked over to where Mrs. Archer sat.</p>
<p>She looked up at him for a moment in silence, surveying
with frank approval his long length, his wide
chest and lean flanks, the clean-cut face which showed
such few signs of fatigue or strain. Then her glance
grew quizzical.</p>
<p>&#8220;You give yourself away too quickly,&#8221; she smiled.
&#8220;Even an old woman scarcely feels complimented
when a man looks downcast at the sight of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rubbish!&#8221; retorted Buck. &#8220;You know it wasn&#8217;t
that.&#8221; Bending swiftly, he put an arm about her
shoulders and kissed her. &#8220;You brought it on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
yourself,&#8221; he told her, grinning, as he straightened up.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve no business to look so&mdash;pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pink in Mrs. Archer&#8217;s cheeks deepened faintly.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you rather lavish this morning?&#8221; she murmured
teasingly. &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better save those
for&mdash;&#8221; Suddenly her face grew serious. &#8220;I do
understand, of course. She hasn&#8217;t come out yet, but
she&#8217;s dressing. I made her eat her breakfast in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good business,&#8221; approved Buck. &#8220;How is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very much better, physically. Her nerves are
practically all right again; but of course she&#8217;s very
much depressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stratton&#8217;s face clouded. &#8220;She still persists&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archer nodded. &#8220;Oh, dear me, yes! That
is, she thinks she does. But there&#8217;s no need to look
as if all hope were lost. Indeed, I&#8217;m quite certain
that a little pressure at the right moment&mdash;&#8221; She
broke off, glancing at the bedroom door. &#8220;I&#8217;ve an
idea it would be better for me to do a little missionary
work first. Suppose you go now and come back later.
Come back,&#8221; she finished briskly, &#8220;when you see my
handkerchief lying here on the window-ledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded and was half way across the room when
she called to him guardedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Buck! There&#8217;s a phrase I noticed in that
rather lurid magazine Bud brought me two or three
weeks ago.&#8221; Her eyes twinkled. &#8220;&#8216;Cave-man stuff,&#8217;
I think it was.&#8221; Coming from her lips the words had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
an oddly bizarre sound. &#8220;It seemed descriptive. Of
course one would want to use refinements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I get you!&#8221; Stratton grinned as he departed.</p>
<p>His head had scarcely passed the window before the
inner door opened and Mary Thorne appeared.</p>
<p>Her face was pale, with deep shadows under the eyes,
and her slim, girlish figure drooped listlessly. She
walked slowly over to the table, took up a book, fluttered
the pages, and laid it down again. Then a pile
of mail caught her eyes, and picking up the topmost
letter, she tore it open and glanced through it indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Stella,&#8221; she commented aloud, dropping it
on the table. &#8220;They got home all right. She says she
had a wonderful time, and asks after&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After me, I suppose,&#8221; said Mrs. Archer, as Mary
paused. &#8220;Give her my love when you write.&#8221; She
hesitated, glancing shrewdly at the girl. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
want to hear the news, dear?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Mary turned abruptly, her eyes widening with
sudden interest. &#8220;News? What news?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, about everything that&#8217;s happened. They
caught all of the men except that wretch, Pedro. The
sheriff&#8217;s taken them to Perilla for trial. He says
they&#8217;ll surely be convicted. Better yet, one of them
has turned State&#8217;s evidence and implicated a swindler
named Draper, who was at the bottom of everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything?&#8221; repeated the girl in a slightly puzzled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
tone, as she dropped listlessly into a chair beside her
aunt. &#8220;What do you mean, dear, by&mdash;everything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How dull I am!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Archer. &#8220;I hope
that isn&#8217;t another sign of encroaching age. I quite
forgot you hadn&#8217;t heard what it was all about. It
seems there&#8217;s oil in the north pasture. Lynch found
it and told this man Draper, and ever since then
they&#8217;ve been trying to force you to sell the ranch so
they could gobble it up themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oil?&#8221; questioned Mary. &#8220;You mean oil wells,
and that sort of thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be wells in time, I presume; just now it&#8217;s
merely in the ground. I understand it&#8217;s quite valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went on to explain in detail all she knew.
Mary listened silently, head bent and hands absently
plucking at the plaiting of her gown. When Mrs.
Archer finally ceased speaking, the girl made no comment
for a time, but sat quite motionless, with drooping
face and nervously moving fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear about&mdash;about&mdash;&#8221; she began in
an uncertain voice, and then stopped, unable to go
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; returned Mrs. Archer simply. &#8220;Bud
told me. It&#8217;s a&mdash;a terrible thing, of course, but I
think&mdash;&#8221; She paused, choosing her words. &#8220;You
mustn&#8217;t spoil your life, my dear, by taking it&mdash;too
seriously.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></p>
<p>Mary turned suddenly and stared at her, surprise
battling with the misery in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too seriously!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;How can I possibly
help taking it seriously? It&#8217;s too dreadful and&mdash;and
horrible, almost, to think of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dreadful, I admit,&#8221; returned the old lady
composedly. &#8220;But after all, it&#8217;s your father&#8217;s doings.
You are not to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl made a swift, dissenting gesture with both
hands. &#8220;Perhaps not, in the way you mean. I
didn&#8217;t do the&mdash;stealing.&#8221; Her voice was bitter. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t even know about it. But I&mdash;profited. Oh,
how could Dad ever have done such an awful thing?
When I think of his&mdash;his deliberately robbing this
man who&mdash;who had given his life bravely for his
country, I could die of shame!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips quivered and she buried her face in her
hands. Mrs. Archer reached out and patted her
shoulder consolingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t die for his country,&#8221; she reminded
her niece practically. &#8220;He&#8217;s very much alive, and here.
He&#8217;s got his ranch back, with the addition of valuable
oil deposits, or whatever you call them, which, Bud
tells me, might not have been discovered for years
but for this.&#8221; She paused, her eyes fixed intently
on the girl. &#8220;Do you&mdash;love him, Mary?&#8221; she asked
abruptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></p>
<p>The girl looked up at her, a slow flush creeping
into her face. &#8220;What difference does that make?&#8221;
she protested. &#8220;I could never make up to him for&mdash;for
what&mdash;father did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes every difference in the world,&#8221; retorted
Mrs. Archer positively. &#8220;As for making up&mdash; Why,
don&#8217;t you know that you&#8217;re more to him than ranches,
or oil wells, or&mdash;anything on earth? You must
realize that in your heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Placing her handkerchief on the window-ledge, she
rose briskly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really must go and change my shoes,&#8221; she said
in quite a different tone. &#8220;These slippers seem to&mdash;er&mdash;pinch
a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they really did pinch, there was no sign of it
as she crossed the room and disappeared through a
door at the farther end. Mary stared after her,
puzzled and a little hurt at the apparent lack of sympathy
in one to whom she had always turned for comfort
and understanding. Then her mind flashed back
to her aunt&#8217;s farewell words, and her brow wrinkled
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>A knock at the door made her start nervously, and
for a long moment she hesitated before replying.
At the sight of Buck Stratton standing on the
threshold, she flushed painfully and sprang to her
feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; he said gently, as he came quickly
over to her. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;re feeling a lot better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she answered briefly. &#8220;I&#8217;m really quite
all right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had taken her hand and still held it, and somehow
the mere pressure of his fingers embarrassed her
oddly and seemed to weaken her resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t quite look it,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;I
reckon it&#8217;ll take some time to get rid of those&mdash;those
shadows and hollows and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was looking down at her with that same tender,
whimsical smile that quirked the corners of his mouth
unevenly, and the expression in his eyes set Mary&#8217;s
heart to fluttering. She could not bear it, somehow!
To give him up was even harder than she had expected,
and suddenly her lids drooped defensively to
hide the bright glitter that smarted in her eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly he broke the brief silence. &#8220;When are
you going to marry me, dear?&#8221; he asked quietly.</p>
<p>Her lids flew up and she stared at him through a
blurring haze of tears. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried unsteadily.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t! I&mdash;can&#8217;t. You&mdash;you don&#8217;t know how I
feel. It&#8217;s all too&mdash;dreadful! It doesn&#8217;t seem as if
I could ever&mdash;look you in the face again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftly his arms slid about her, and she was drawn
gently but irresistibly to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try just now, dear, if you&#8217;d rather not,&#8221; he
murmured, smiling down into her tear-streaked face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a long time to get used to it, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instinctively she tried to struggle. Then all at once
a wave of incredible happiness swept over her.
Abruptly nothing seemed to matter&mdash;nothing on earth
save this one thing. With a little sigh like that of a
tired child, her arm stole up about his neck, her head
fell gently back against his shoulder.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Mary said abruptly, struck by a sudden
recollection. It was an hour later, and they sat together
on the sofa. &#8220;I had a letter from Stella to-day.&#8221;
A faintly mischievous light sparkled in her
eyes. &#8220;She sent her love&mdash;to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck flushed a little under his tan. &#8220;Some little
kidder, isn&#8217;t she, on short acquaintance?&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Short!&#8221; Mary&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;Why, she knew
you before I did!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so, but I didn&#8217;t know her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck had rather dreaded the moment when he
would have to tell her of that beastly, vanished year,
but somehow he did not find it hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as you don&#8217;t ever let it happen again, I
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she smiled, when he had finished. &#8220;I
simply couldn&#8217;t bear it, though, if you should lose
your memory&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No danger,&#8221; he assured her, with a look that deepened
the color in her radiant face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>For a moment she did not speak. Then all at once
her smile faded and she turned quickly to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The&mdash;the ranch, dear,&#8221; she said abruptly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something, isn&#8217;t there, I should do about&mdash;about
turning it over&mdash;to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew her head down against his shoulder. &#8220;No
use bothering about that now,&#8221; he shrugged. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to be made one so soon that&mdash; How about riding
to Perilla to-morrow and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Buck!&#8221; she protested. &#8220;I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>His arm tightened about her. &#8220;Well, say the day
after,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have to
spend our honeymoon right here getting things to
rights, so you won&#8217;t have to get a lot of new clothes
and all that. There&#8217;s nothing unlucky about Thursday,
is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>She hid her face against his coat. &#8220;No-o; but I
don&#8217;t see how&mdash;I can&mdash;so soon. Well, maybe&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Of all the amusements which can possibly be imagined for a hard-working
man, after his daily toil, or, in its intervals, there is
nothing like reading an entertaining book. It calls for no bodily
exertion. It transports him into a livelier, and gayer, and more
diversified and interesting scene, and while he enjoys himself there
he may forget the evils of the present moment. Nay, it accompanies
him to his next day&#8217;s work, and gives him something to think of besides
